			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distributing FXRuby-based applications to end-users who don&#8217;t have Ruby (or FXRuby) installed on their computers can be a challenge. Fortunately, there are a number of freely available tools for building &#8220;standalone&#8221; versions of Ruby applications. In this post, we&#8217;re going to focus on how to use <a href="http://exerb.sourceforge.jp/index.en.html">Exerb</a>, developed by Yuya Kato, to build standalone FXRuby applications on Windows.</p>
<p>The first step is to <a href="http://exerb.sourceforge.jp/index.en.html#download">download</a> and install the latest Exerb distribution (version 4.2.0, as of this writing). It&#8217;s packaged as a ZIP file, which you&#8217;ll need to extract into some convenient place on your hard drive. Once that&#8217;s done, change directories into the <tt>exerb-4.2.0</tt> directory and run the <tt>setup.rb</tt> script.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="bash bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">cd</span> exerb-4.2.0
ruby setup.rb</pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Now, to actually go through the process of building a standalone FXRuby application, let&#8217;s start with a simple example. We&#8217;ll use the <a href="http://www.fxruby.org/examples/hello.rb">hello.rb</a> example program from the FXRuby source code distribution. The first step is to generate a &#8220;recipe&#8221; file for your Ruby application, which is basically a listing of all the files that Exerb should use to build the executable. You&#8217;ll use the <tt>mkexy</tt> tool to do this.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="bash bash" style="font-family:monospace;">ruby <span style="color: #660033;">-r</span> exerb<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>mkexy hello.rb</pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>The <tt>mkexy</tt> tool runs your application in a custom version of Ruby to analyze which libraries it requires while it&#8217;s running. Once you exit the application, <tt>mkexy</tt> spits out a recipe file (for this example, <tt>hello.exy</tt>) in the current working directory.</p>
<p>Now that you have a recipe, you&#8217;re ready to run Exerb to generate the executable.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="bash bash" style="font-family:monospace;">exerb hello.exy</pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Note that the executable that Exerb creates is quite large, as it bundles both a copy of the Ruby interpreter as well as the FXRuby library code. When I did this experiment, the executable weighed in at close to 9 Mb. You can distribute this executable to other people who don&#8217;t have Ruby or FXRuby installed on their computers.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at a slightly more complicated example, the <a href="http://www.fxruby.org/examples/hello2.rb">hello2.rb</a> program. The complication is that this example uses an external file, a PNG icon that it loads from disk at runtime, as shown in this excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="ruby ruby" style="font-family:monospace;">icon = <span style="color:#0000FF; font-weight:bold;">nil</span>
<span style="color:#CC00FF; font-weight:bold;">File</span>.<span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">open</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#CC00FF; font-weight:bold;">File</span>.<span style="color:#9900CC;">join</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#996600;">&quot;icons&quot;</span>, <span style="color:#996600;">&quot;hello2.png&quot;</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span>, <span style="color:#996600;">&quot;rb&quot;</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span> |input|
  icon = FXPNGIcon.<span style="color:#9900CC;">new</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span>application, input.<span style="color:#9900CC;">read</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span>
<span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span></pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>This is unfortunately something that Exerb doesn&#8217;t handle very well, but there is a workaround. What we must first do is dump the contents of the PNG icon to a Ruby string, and store the contents in a regular <tt>.rb</tt> file. Here&#8217;s some code to do that:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="ruby ruby" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color:#CC00FF; font-weight:bold;">File</span>.<span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">open</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#CC00FF; font-weight:bold;">File</span>.<span style="color:#9900CC;">join</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#996600;">&quot;icons&quot;</span>, <span style="color:#996600;">&quot;hello2.png&quot;</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span>, <span style="color:#996600;">&quot;rb&quot;</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span> |input|
  bytes = input.<span style="color:#9900CC;">read</span>
  <span style="color:#CC00FF; font-weight:bold;">File</span>.<span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">open</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#996600;">&quot;hello2_icon.rb&quot;</span>, <span style="color:#996600;">&quot;w&quot;</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span> |output|
    output.<span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">puts</span> <span style="color:#996600;">&quot;ICON = #{bytes.inspect}&quot;</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span>
<span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span></pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Now we need to modify the bit in <tt>hello2.rb</tt> that loads the icon data, so that it instead loads this Ruby code instead:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="ruby ruby" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">require</span> <span style="color:#996600;">'hello2_icon'</span>
icon = FXPNGIcon.<span style="color:#9900CC;">new</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span>application, ICON<span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span></pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Now, run the <tt>mkexy</tt> tool as before to generate a recipe file (<tt>hello2.exy</tt>) and then <tt>exerb</tt> to generate the executable.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="bash bash" style="font-family:monospace;">ruby <span style="color: #660033;">-r</span> exerb<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>mkexy hello2.rb
exerb hello2.exy</pre></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>There are at least a couple of other tools out there for building standalone Ruby applications, including Erik Veenstra&#8217;s <a href="http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/">RubyScript2Exe</a> and Jeremy Hinegardner&#8217;s <a href="http://copiousfreetime.rubyforge.org/crate/">Crate</a>. I&#8217;m not at all familiar with how those tools work, but if you&#8217;ve had luck building standalone FXRuby applications with either of these tools, I&#8217;d love to hear about your experience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thursday morning, first day of RubyConf. Matz has finished his keynote address and a check of my watch tells me that I&#8217;ve got some time to kill before Gregg Pollack&#8217;s talk on &#8220;Scaling Rails&#8221; starts at 10:25, so I head up to my hotel room for a bit. Unfortunately, when I returned to the conference room around 10:20, I found that Gregg had already begun his presentation to a standing-room-only audience. I wasn&#8217;t surprised that the room had filled up. Gregg is known to be a great presenter, and the topic is one of interest to most Rubyists these days.</p>
<p>As much as I was looking forward to seeing his talk, I&#8217;m not a big fan of standing in one place for 30 or 45 minutes, even if I have a wall to lean against, so I headed next door to sit in on David Koontz&#8217;s talk on <a href="http://monkeybars.rubyforge.org/">Monkeybars</a>. No problem, I figured, because the <a href="http://confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> guys were there recording all of the talks, and the video of Gregg&#8217;s talk would be up on their web site at some point after the conference ended. As David Black had noted in a conversation the night before, the fact that you can just catch videos of any of the talks you might have missed has quelled his concerns about RubyConf evolving from a single-track conference to one with multiple tracks.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this morning, and I&#8217;m reading Peter Cooper&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/scaling-ruby-the-informative-40-minute-screencast-1337.html">review</a> of one of the latest <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/">RailsEnvy</a> screencasts, entitled (wait for it) &#8220;Scaling Ruby&#8221;. It is a 40-minute long, highly polished version of the presentation that Gregg gave at RubyConf, and it sells for $9. And I think this is great. Gregg and Jason provide a ton of absolutely free material to the Ruby and Rails community, including their popular weekly RailsEnvy podcasts. I&#8217;m sure that a lot of work went into producing the video, as well as the PDF that comes with it, and it is probably a great value for anyone who&#8217;s interested in purchasing it.</p>
<p>The thing that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> realize until I got to the review&#8217;s comments section, however, is that Gregg apparently chose not to have his RubyConf presentation recorded. I didn&#8217;t even realize that this was an option, probably because it&#8217;s an option that no other RubyConf presenter has ever exercised. Jeremy McAnally, organizer of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com/">Ruby Hoedown</a>, also <a href="http://twitter.com/jeremymcanally/status/1009810803">indicated</a> that Gregg didn&#8217;t want his Hoedown talk recorded either. Bottom line: If you (like me) missed his talk at RubyConf this year, you&#8217;re not going to see it.</p>
<p>Gregg did chime in with <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/scaling-ruby-the-informative-40-minute-screencast-1337.html#comment-37371">his response</a> to some of the negative comments on the review, and you can (and should) read those to hear his side of the story. His defense is that he put a lot of time into preparing for his presentation, and that he deserves to be compensated for that, and that if a free Confreaks recording of the same material were available that no one would buy the screencast. All of those things are probably true. (He does neglect to mention that the $250 conference registration fee is waived for presenters; perhaps he also chose to pay that fee in lieu of having his talk recorded.)</p>
<p>Let me be clear that while it is quite possibly a serious PR blunder on his part, Gregg didn&#8217;t break any &#8220;rules&#8221; and hasn&#8217;t done anything unethical per se. There&#8217;s also nothing on the <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf site</a>, or in the conference materials, that guarantees video of each and every conference presentation will eventually be available on the Confreaks site. And before someone accuses me of being a free software zealot who believes that &#8220;information wants to be free&#8221;, let me reiterate that I&#8217;m not opposed to folks <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby/fxruby">charging money</a> for their work. Baby needs new shoes and all that. I would simply request that in the future RubyConf organizers consider requiring conference speakers to agree to have their talks recorded; or, barring that, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">being a little more up-front</span> somehow communicating with conference attendees about <em>which</em> conference presentations are truly &#8220;can&#8217;t miss&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have an hour or so to kill while I&#8217;m waiting here in the Orlando airport for my flight back to Huntsville, so I thought I&#8217;d post a quick summary of RubyConf 2008.</p>
<p>The conference was held at the <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/OrlandoChampionsGate.aspx">Omni Orlando Resort at ChampionsGate</a>. The Omni is big place, and they were hosting several other conferences at the same time as as RubyConf (including, ironically, some sort of tanning convention). The resort has two or three swimming pools, including a &#8220;lazy river&#8221; which I took advantage of for a couple of hours on Saturday afternoon. They also have a golf course if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing, and free shuttle access to the Disney parks. As a location for a technical conference, however, the Omni is sort of a mixed bag. There are a number of seating places throughout the hotel where groups of Rubyists could gather to talk or hack on things, which was convenient. The (free) Wi-Fi coverage throughout the hotel was also very good. The resort is fairly isolated, however, and as a result those of us without cars were mostly restricted to eating at the pricey on-site restaurants. A shortage of power outlets in the conference rooms also presented a challenge for those of us using notebooks with short battery lives, but in hindsight I think it was a good thing that I wasn&#8217;t able to leave my computer open for very long during the presentations. I was a lot less distracted by IRC, Twitter, e-mail, etc. and I got a lot more out of the presentations as a result.</p>
<p>If there was a unifying theme for this year&#8217;s RubyConf, it was probably &#8220;love&#8221;. We heard a <em>lot</em> about <a href="http://twitter.com/fmedlin/statuses/996297194">love</a> this weekend. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing, but it was no doubt a reaction to some of the pre-conference controversy and the more general problem of divisions in the Ruby community that have become more pronounced over the last couple of years. We also took time out to recognize the contributions of <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/166658">Guy Decoux</a> and <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/OpenBSD/Jun-ichiro_itojun_Hagino">Itojun</a>, both important Rubyists who passed away this past year.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s RubyConf had three tracks, and I saw a lot of really excellent presentations. I&#8217;m not going to try to summarize the talks, because the conference videos will be up on the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> site in due time, but I will mention a couple of presentations that you should look for. I&#8217;ve been trying to up my testing game over the last month or so, and Francis Hwang&#8217;s talk on &#8220;Testing Heresies&#8221; (Thursday afternoon) dealt with a number of dogmatic beliefs that we tend to have about testing and why some of those ideas may not hold up under examination. Greg Borenstein&#8217;s presenation on &#8220;Ruby Arduino Development&#8221; (Friday morning) was really interesting to me, and included a number of really compelling demos (including, at the end, a Ruby-powered drink mixer). Jim Weirich&#8217;s talk on &#8220;What Every Rubyist Should Know About Threads&#8221; (Friday afternoon) was a good refresher course for me; as I told someone, about once a year I need to hear (or read) what someone smarter than me has to say about developing mutli-threaded applications, so I&#8217;m sure still on the right track. Jake Scruggs&#8217; talk on metrics (also on Friday afternoon) was a good survey of the tools available for static code analysis (such as <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov">RCov</a>, <a href="http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html">Flog</a>, and <a href="http://saikuro.rubyforge.org/">Saikuro</a>) and how to interpret their results. Finally, Neal Ford&#8217;s talk on &#8220;Advanced DSLs in Ruby&#8221; (on Saturday morning) covered a number of techniques for building DSLs in Ruby and the best practices for doing so (along with some of the problems you can run into in the process).</p>
<p>So, all in all, another great RubyConf. Many thanks to <a href="http://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a>, the conference organizers, and <a href="http://www.fiveruns.com/">FiveRuns</a>, the conference sponsor!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second annual <a href="http://www.rubyhoedown.com/">Ruby Hoedown</a> was held this past weekend in Huntsville, Alabama. Every time I attend one of these Ruby conferences, I go into it with good intentions to take notes about each presentation so that I can refer back to them later. It never quite works out that way. Luckily for you, Jason Seifer of the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/">RailsEnvy</a> blog has put together a nice <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/8/8/ruby-hoedown-day-1">overview</a> of the first day&#8217;s proceedings (and hopefully a recap of Day 2 is forthcoming). At some point in the future you will of course be able to see videos of all the presentations at the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> site.</p>
<p>I think I may have been a little under the weather, or maybe it&#8217;s just old age, but for whatever reason it was a really low energy weekend for me and as a result I didn&#8217;t get as much out of the conference as I&#8217;d hoped. I also came to realize that there are some downsides to attending a Ruby conference in your home town: when (if) you head home after the conference is over, you miss out on a lot of the informal stuff (like hacking and Werewolf) that takes place in the conference hotel(s) after hours. But it was a great conference nonetheless, and I do want to comment on a few things that I observed.</p>
<p>The RailsEnvy guys kicked things off with a whirlwind tour of &#8220;Ruby Innovations&#8221; during the last year or so. They actually went into more depth than I was expecting, and it was a really informative and entertaining presentation. Hopefully, they will post their slides soon, as it&#8217;s just too long of a list for me to try to reproduce here in any detail.</p>
<p>Next up was Robert Dempsey, who spoke generally about cloud computing and more specifically about how you could use Ruby and Rails with cloud computing services. It was an interesting topic, but Robert spent a lot of time talking about the various vendors of cloud computing solutions and comparing their plans, at the cost of a rushed presentation towards the end of how to actually do anything with those services. Given the audience, it might have been better to just pick one of those services for demonstration purposes and focus on showing actual running code.</p>
<p>Jim Weirch&#8217;s and Joe O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s wonderful &#8220;Mock Dialogue&#8221; presentation confirmed what I already knew, which is that I still have a lot to learn about software testing. I understand why it&#8217;s important, and I <em>do</em> it, but I&#8217;ve always had the feeling that I&#8217;m not doing it quite right. During a subsequent lightning talk, Bryan Liles mentioned that when he decided to get serious about testing, he made a point of really digging in and studying it, to see how other people were testing (or maybe I just imagined that he said that). I think that&#8217;s what I need to do, really immerse myself in it until it comes more naturally.</p>
<p>There was actually a lot of focus on testing throughout the conference, another reminder of how integral the concept is to software development with Ruby and Rails. I was really looking forward to Rick Bradley&#8217;s talk (on day two), which promised to &#8220;show how to transform a Ruby     application without tests into a well-spec&#8217;d system with     good test coverage.&#8221; Given that I&#8217;ve recently started working with two large Rails applications that have no tests, I was hoping that Rick would reveal some big secret that would solve this problem for me in no time. As it turns out, the method that he outlined, of writing what he calls &#8220;characterization tests&#8221; as a stepping stone to real specifications (and refactoring along the way) is more or less what I&#8217;ve been doing. Ah, well. Work goes on.</p>
<p>The last regular presentation on Friday afternoon was Rein Henrichs&#8217; talk on &#8220;Ruby Best Practice Patterns&#8221;. Because I had only a few days earlier read Rein&#8217;s article in <a href="http://therubyist.com/"><em>The Rubyist</em></a>, I didn&#8217;t get a lot of new information from this talk&#8212;but that&#8217;s not Rein&#8217;s fault. It was entertaining, and he was able to use humor to make his point very effectively. There was also a really good discussion during the following Q&amp;A about what constitutes &#8220;best practices&#8221; in Ruby software development. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading Rein&#8217;s upcoming book on this topic.</p>
<p>Chris Wanstrath&#8217;s keynote presentation on Friday evening was unlike any other I&#8217;ve seen at a Ruby conference, and it was a nice change. He talked about a lot of things, but what I took from it was that it&#8217;s important to keep refining your skills because you never know what opportunities those skills will lead to; you may not ever paid for your work on open source side projects, but the experience that you receive and connections that you make may result in new employment or business opportunities. It was an inspiring speech (without any slides), and I hope he&#8217;s planning to post the text on his blog.</p>
<p>Day two started with Troy Davis&#8217; presentation on &#8220;<span class="talk">Calling Your Code: Gluing Phone Calls to Ruby&#8221;. I noticed that Troy was throwing around a good bit of technical jargon, but I was late arriving to his talk and it may be that he explained a lot of those terms at the beginning. Regardless, it didn&#8217;t take away from the impact of the live demos that he gave of the technology. Troy demonstrated two or three really neat applications that used Ruby (via <a href="http://adhearsion.com/">Adhearsion</a>) to accept and react to incoming phone calls, or to place outgoing calls.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Another issue that I&#8217;ve been dealing with in those Rails applications that I mentioned earlier is the sometimes complex business logic used to determine how the models transition between various states. I was familiar with how rule engines worked, and I&#8217;d even heard Joe Kutner talk about his <a href="http://ruleby.org/">Ruleby</a> project before, but it wasn&#8217;t until his presentation on Saturday afternoon that it finally started to click with me about how I might be able to use this to extract and codify the various rules that have snaked their way throughout the models and controllers of our code base.</p>
<p>Heading into the conference, there was a lot of hype about Giles Bowkett&#8217;s <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/02/archaeopteryx-ruby-midi-generator.html">Archaeopteryx</a> talk (versions of which he&#8217;s given at earlier conferences). I made a point of not viewing any of the videos from the previous times he&#8217;s given this talk, so I don&#8217;t know how much this one differed from those, but it wasn&#8217;t exactly what I was expecting. Without giving too much away, Archaeopteryx isn&#8217;t the <em>real</em> focus of the talk. Watch it if you get a chance. It was entertaining, to be sure: Giles&#8217; presentation style is sort of a <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html">Takahashi</a> on speed. I predicted in the IRC backchannel that his presentation would spawn a lot of bad copycats (of his style, not the content) and was assured that there has already been at least one such (failed) attempt.</p>
<p>The conference closed with David Black&#8217;s Saturday evening keynote talk on Ruby versions, past and present. It&#8217;s really cool to see someone with a such a deep understanding of the language (as David has) workthrough the evolution of Ruby from its earliest days until the present. He began with a demonstration of Ruby version 1.0, noting some of the bread-and-butter Ruby features that were missing from that version (such as the frequently used <tt>puts</tt> and <tt>methods</tt> methods), but also highlighting some of the core metaprogramming features that were already present even in that very first release (such as opening singleton classes to add functionality to instances). During the latter part of his presentation, he introduced some of the new features from Ruby 1.9 and talked about the implications of those changes. It was a great way to wrap up the conference.</p>
<p>As always, one of the best things to come out of the weekend was the opportunity to meet new people and learn from them. One of my concerns over the last few months has been what we could do to jump-start our local Ruby and Rails user group. The group was originally organized last summer, and we got off to a reasonably good start, but as time went on people lost interest and the group is more or less disbanded at this point. Which is unfortunate, because if the number of people subscribed to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hsvrb?hl=en">our Google group</a> is any indication, there&#8217;s a good bit of interest in Ruby and Rails in this area. So I made a point of speaking to several people about what has or hasn&#8217;t worked in their local user groups, to get an idea of how we might reconstitute the Huntsville group. I think that a major problem we had was that there was no focus for the meetings. We couldn&#8217;t get very many people to sign up to give presentations, and as a result most meetings involved the guys sitting around and chatting for awhile before taking off. One suggestion to overcome this was to try out a lightning talks format, to engage people who don&#8217;t have the time to put together a full-blown formal presentation but might willing to speak for five or ten minutes on something interesting that they&#8217;re working on. Another suggestion was to try to organize a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> or some other sort of informal conference, to bring more attention to the group.</p>
<p>Somewhere around the end of the first day, Jeremy announced that he&#8217;s working on Nashville&#8217;s Opryland Hotel as the site for next year&#8217;s Hoedown. His goal is to have the conference funded entirely by sponsors, and for attendance to be free (it was $199 this year). It&#8217;s an ambitious goal to be sure, but I&#8217;m interested in seeing how things turn out and to what degree it will impact attendance and participation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Users of Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme">MobileMe</a> have put up with a lot over the past couple of weeks since the service was launched. Many of these problems have to do with the availability of the service; for example, as I&#8217;m writing this, <a title="Some MobileMe Users Still Without Email" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/21/some-mobileme-users-still-without-email/">a number of people have been without access to their MobileMe e-mail accounts</a> for several days. That&#8217;s bad, to be sure, but it seems like the kind of problem that Apple will correct pretty soon.</p>
<p>One of the latest shoes to drop, however, is the apparent lack of support for syncing with <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/default.aspx">Microsoft Outlook</a> calendars that are hosted on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Exchange_Server">Exchange</a> servers. A big part of the MobileMe vision was that you could install some software on your Windows-based PC, and sync your Outlook calendars with the same cloud of data that all of your other devices (such as your MacBook and iPhone) were synched to. And depending on who you ask, this seems to be working if you&#8217;re operating Outlook in &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; mode (as most home users presumably do).</p>
<p>Those of us who are using Outlook at work, however, tend to have Outlook hooked up to an Exchange server, so that we can share calendars and contacts and what-not with our co-workers. I (and apparently many others) have been struggling with this configuration, trying to get it to work. For me particularly, it&#8217;s the calendars that just don&#8217;t seem to sync at all. I have a default calendar (named &#8220;Calendar&#8221;) in Outlook, and that&#8217;s the one that all of my work events get scheduled on. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to sync this one to Mobile Me at all. The additional calendars that I&#8217;ve created seemed to sync properly at first, but now it seems that events that I add to those calendars in Outlook never get pushed up to the MobileMe server (and thus they never appear on any of my other copies of those calendars).</p>
<p>Given all of the other MobileMe snafus that people have been dealing with since the launch, it was easy for me to assume that this was just another thing that Apple didn&#8217;t quite have working right, which would be repaired in short-ish order. More recent <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1619249&amp;tstart=15">posts</a> on Apple&#8217;s support forums suggest, however, that not only is this not going to be fixed, but that it&#8217;s this way <em>by design</em>.</p>
<p>Apple has already had to issue one major <a title="Apple Sends Apology Letter, 30-Day Extension to MobileMe Customers" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/16/apple-sends-apology-letter-30-day-extension-to-mobileme-customers/">mea culpa</a> regarding their false advertising of push capability for the desktop clients of MobileMe. As more people become aware of the &#8220;resolution&#8221; of this Exchange-synching problem, confidence in MobileMe is only going to lessen.</p>
<p>Come on, Google. Give us push-synching of our Google e-mail, calendars and contacts. If it works, I&#8217;ll even give you the $99 a year I might have paid Apple for MobileMe.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I periodically use Google&#8217;s <a title="Google Blog Search" href="http://blogsearch.google.com">Blog Search</a> tool to look for references to <a title="FXRuby Home Page" href="http://www.fxruby.org/">FXRuby</a>, and today&#8217;s search turned up a couple of <a href="http://redworld.blog.ubuntu.org.cn/2008/07/01/fxruby%e5%88%9d%e4%bd%93%e9%aa%8cpart1/">recent</a> <a href="http://redworld.blog.ubuntu.org.cn/2008/07/01/fxruby%e5%88%9d%e4%bd%93%e9%aa%8cpart2/">posts</a> on a Chinese language blog. Curious to know what it was that this blogger was writing, and me not being able to read Chinese, I ran the pages through Google&#8217;s <a title="Google Translate" href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=en">Translate</a> service to see if I could get some idea.</p>
<p>As is often the case with machine translation, the results were more humorous than enlightening. The closing line of the first entry translates as:</p>
<blockquote><p><span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()">Seems too long, put another log on the open bar.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this gem from the second post:</p>
<blockquote><p><span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()"> The structure is so clear, I think if that is what MFC of the poor children who will have to see after that what the MFC threw it easy.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>All joking aside, the good news is that someone in China is taking the time to blog about FXRuby, and about <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby">the book</a> (maybe they even paid for it!). It&#8217;s gratifying to think that people in other countries are reading what I&#8217;ve written.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy McAnally has just announced the talks that we&#8217;ll be seeing at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rubyhoedown.com/">Ruby Hoedown</a>, and it&#8217;s a really great-looking lineup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giles Bowkett will be speaking about <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/02/archaeopteryx-ruby-midi-generator.html">Archaeopteryx</a>, a Ruby-based system for auto-generating, self-modifying music. I&#8217;ve heard nothing but rave reviews of this project, which Giles has previously spoken about at GoRuCo and the MountainWest Ruby Conference.</li>
<li>Gregg Pollack and Jason Seifer (of <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/">RailsEnvy</a> blog and podcast fame) will be speaking about a number of the most useful, ingenious and innovative developments to come out of the Ruby community over the past year. If you saw Gregg and Jason in the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/6/3/mvc-videos">MVC Public Service Announcement videos</a> at RailsConf, you know that this is bound to be an entertaining presentation.</li>
<li>Rick Bradley will be speaking about the problem of transforming a Ruby application that doesn&#8217;t have any tests into one that&#8217;s well-spec&#8217;d and has good test coverage. I&#8217;m especially looking forward to hearing this talk!</li>
<li>Rein Henrichs is the author of an upcoming book on Ruby best practice patterns (inspired by Kent Beck&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X">Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns</a></cite> book) and he&#8217;ll be speaking about that, with examples from the book.</li>
<li>Robert Dempsey will be speaking on how to employ Ruby in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">&#8220;cloud computing&#8221;</a> applications, via services like Amazon.com&#8217;s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>. This is another talk that I&#8217;m looking forward to, given all of the recent development in this area.</li>
<li>Joe Kutner will be speaking about <a http="http://www.ruleby.org/">Ruleby</a>, a rule engine for Ruby. If you&#8217;ve never used a rule engine before, you may be surprised to learn how this declarative style of programming can complement the procedural Ruby code that you&#8217;re used to.</li>
<li>Finally, Troy Davis will take a look at different APIs you can use to develop Ruby applications that can interact with phone calls to varying degrees (via platforms like <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> and <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org/">FreeSWITCH</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we&#8217;ll have a Charity Tutorial Breakfast session during which Jim Weirich and Joe O&#8217;Brien will discuss the use of mock objects in testing. Sounds good, right? If you haven&#8217;t registered yet, <a href="http://rubyhoedown.eventwax.com/ruby-hoedown-2008/register">get to it</a>! The <a href="http://www.rubyhoedown.com/">Hoedown</a> will be held August 8 and 9 in Huntsville, Alabama. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
