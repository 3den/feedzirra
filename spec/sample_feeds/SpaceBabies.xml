			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry for the acronym soup, but part of my job is research and development of new website building techniques. I have found a neat and <em>fast</em> way of maintaining websites in the nanoc + haml + vlad combo.<br />
<span id="more-270"></span><a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a> is a tool that runs on my local computer and compiles small Ruby documents into static web pages, ready for uploading to my web host. What&#8217;s so neat about it? It separates a website into content and meta-data. The meta-data is structured like an array. This is fairly technical, but once setup I rarely need to touch it again. The content is just the text in the page; basically just a .txt file that any moron (such as me) could maintain.</p>
<p>For simple sites, this really beats having to maintain entire .html files. The content files really are simple text documents, no html noise. When I am done editing these text files, I press a button and they are compiled into complete html documents with all the HEAD, META, BODY and whathaveyou goodness. I can FTP that over and the site is live, boom!</p>
<h2>Markup haiku</h2>
<p>Now of course when I say text document, that is almost the case. Being a web geek I do want some structure in there: bulleted lists, headers, a table maybe. To represent structure in simple text files most people choose Markdown. This works quite well. You create html bulleted lists by slapping asterisks in your text file. For reasons of sheer R&#038;D I decided to go with <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">haml</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Haml takes your gross, ugly templates and replaces them with veritable <strong>Haiku</strong>. <acronym title="HTML Abstraction Markup Language">Haml</acronym> is the next step in generating views in your Rails application. Haml is a refreshing take that is meant to free us from the shitty templating languages we have gotten used to. Haml is based on one primary principle. <em>Markup should be beautiful.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I have used haml on a project before and thought it was very neat. It basically is a wet dream for the prototypical detail-obsessed, dont-repeat-yourself meta-code-generating geek. Anywho. Haml enables me to express structure like headings and tables in a still very readable text file. So boom, haml was in.</p>
<h2>Get that puppy on the server</h2>
<p>Now for deploying a website to the server: I get sick to my stomach doing that by hand. It really is not a job you want to be doing by hand. You might upload to a wrong folder, your upload might fail, you cannot roll back easily, and what about your visitors? Do you want them to see a site that&#8217;s half-updated? So in the Rails world we use Capistrano and it works really well. In this case I felt the need to use <a href="http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html">Vlad the Deployer</a> for this task. It&#8217;s Capistrano without all the obesity. And what do you know, it actually works. <em>And it&#8217;s fast.</em> Fast is good when deploying.</p>
<p>So now when I am done with my markup haiku, I type svn commit followed by rake vlad:update and just seconds later the updated website is live. And if I make a mistake I can revert back in under a second. Gotta love it.</p>
<p>Ps. I did all this just to maintain a minuscule <a href="http://www.jotocorp.com/">corporate website</a>. But the fun really was in discovering those new tools.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a common use case: localize all built-in strings and date formats of a Rails application in just one language. I don&#8217;t need to switch dynamically, everything should just change to my own language. In my case, Dutch. Here is how I do it with as many built-in things as possible.<br />
<span id="more-262"></span></p>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Make sure you are running Rails version 2.2.2 or higher.</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Set the default locale in an initializer. Create a new file called <strong>config/initializers/default_locale.rb</strong> and put this in it:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" title="Ruby">
<input type="hidden" value="">
<pre class="code">I18n.<span style="color:#9900CC;">default_locale</span> = <span style="color:#996600;">'nl'</span></pre>
</pre>
<p>Of course, use any locale you wish.</p>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Install the localized_dates plugin. This will make sure all your dates are formatted according to your locale.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" title="DOS">
<input type="hidden" value="">
<pre class="code">ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/clemens/localized_dates.git</pre>
</pre>
<h2>Optional: step 4</h2>
<p>Customize the locale file copied to config/locales or grab a new one from <a href="http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails%2Flocale">Sven&#8217;s github</a>. I use a <a href="http://www.spacebabies.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nl.rb">modified version of the Dutch locale</a> since our month names should be lowercase.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Try Googling for the title of this post! A lot has been said about using Ruby to connect to your gmailbox. In short: with Ruby 1.8 you can&#8217;t. With Ruby 1.9 it&#8217;s broken. <a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2006-10-24-connecting-to-gmail-with-ruby-or-connecting-to-pop3-servers-over-ssl-with-ruby">This pos</a>t led me to the right path.</p>
<p><span id="more-257"></span></p>
<p>First thing to do is download a working version of the Ruby 1.9 POP3 library. The most recent version doesn&#8217;t work, so you need to grab an older one. <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/tags/v1_9_0_0/lib/net/pop.rb?revision=13778&#038;view=markup">This one</a>. Download the file and save it as pop_ssl.rb.</p>
<p>Then you need this code to use it:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" title="Ruby">
<input type="hidden" value="lines">
<pre class="code"><span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">require</span> <span style="color:#996600;">'pop_ssl'</span> <span style="color:#008000; font-style:italic;"># I renamed the file from pop.rb to pop_ssl.rb to ensure I was requiring the correct version</span>
&nbsp;
username = <span style="color:#996600;">'YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com'</span>
password = <span style="color:#996600;">'YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD'</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color:#6666ff; font-weight:bold;">Net::POP3</span>.<span style="color:#9900CC;">enable_ssl</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#6666ff; font-weight:bold;">OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span>
<span style="color:#6666ff; font-weight:bold;">Net::POP3</span>.<span style="color:#9900CC;">start</span><span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color:#996600;">'pop.gmail.com'</span>, <span style="color:#006666;">995</span>, username, password<span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">&#41;</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span> <span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">|</span>pop<span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">|</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">if</span> pop.<span style="color:#9900CC;">mails</span>.<span style="color:#9900CC;">empty</span>?
    <span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">puts</span> <span style="color:#996600;">'No mail.'</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">else</span>
    pop.<span style="color:#9900CC;">each_mail</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span> <span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">|</span>mail<span style="color:#006600; font-weight:bold;">|</span>
      <span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">p</span> mail.<span style="color:#9900CC;">header</span>
    <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span>
<span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span></pre>
</pre>
<p>Which I grabbed verbatim from the blogpost linked above.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>or &#8220;why I love unit tests&#8221;. An ode to agile software development. <img src='http://www.spacebabies.nl/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><span id="more-251"></span>It is becoming a theme on this blog, but you are just going to have to deal with it. Earlier this week I completed a massive refactoring of an application and I am still amazed at how easy that went.</p>
<p>What is a refactoring? From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Code refactoring is the process of changing a computer program&#8217;s internal structure without modifying its external behavior or existing functionality. This is usually done to improve code readability, simplify code structure, change code to adhere to a given programming paradigm, improve maintainability, or improve extensibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: change. Usually, changing a live application is a nightmare. Who knows what will break? With for example a PHP site you cannot know this beforehand. And so very often the code is either not changed or a huge problems are introduced.</p>
<p>For radio 1 I completely refactored the <a href="http://www.radio1.nl/podcasts">Podcasts</a> and <a href="http://www.radio1.nl/fragments">Fragments</a> pages and I did it in three days without anything breaking. About a third of the website changed on the inside, but <em>nothing</em> changed on the outside. The Podcast model even changed 90% and the accompanying database table was dropped, in lieu of a Single Table Inheritance model. Each of these things are huge by itself. All pages continued to work and the new things simply got added.</p>
<p>I do not know how I could have do that without an automated test suite. I do not (want to) know how PHP or .Net people do such things. (I fear they often &#8216;hope for the best&#8217;)</p>
<p>So thank you Ruby on Rails and <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> for making this possible.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been unfortunate to have used Windows just recently. I work on a Mac, but to install a new internet server I needed a piece of software the only runs on Windows. So Daniël lent me his laptop and I proceeded to install the software.</p>
<p><span id="more-241"></span></p>
<p>By its nature the installation of a server takes a while: hours in this case. The server is located on the other side of the country, so all I am seeing on the Windows laptop is a virtual screen, that displays stuff that&#8217;s hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p>I started the installation and went to bed, confident that I would find a crisp new server in the morning. Instead I got a laptop that was rebooted! And a server install that was cut off midway, resulting in a broken installation. What the &#8230; ?</p>
<p>Turned out Windows had the audacity to restart the laptop without warning, <strong>in the middle of the server installation process</strong>!! Found this gem in the event log:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe has initiated the restart of computer NUPLAY_PC1 on behalf of user NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM for the following reason: No title for this reason could be found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What<br />
The<br />
Fuck !!!!!</p>
<p>It turns out Windows installed some &#8220;critical&#8221; updates and rebooted all by itself.</p>
<p>Piece of shit OS!!</p>
