			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.zumodrive.com/">ZumoDrive</a> sounds interesting, <a href="http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2009/01/zumodrive_is_going_to_change_everything.html">per this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For $60 a month, you can store 200gb on ZumoDrive. You can stick your whole iTunes album into it, for example, and access it from whatever machine or device you’re using.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neat. It makes it appear as though their &#8220;cloud&#8221; (which is to say: somewhere not where your computer is, ie: internetwork) share is a local volume. I like that idea a lot. Actually, I love that idea. It bugs me that my entire iTunes library has to be carted around on my laptop everywhere I go just because I want to listen to it.</p>
<p>You see, I have a terabyte of networked drive space at home available to every machine on my home network. I&#8217;d much rather have my iTunes library stored on that and accessed via my laptop when I&#8217;m home via the local network (this is trivial). But here&#8217;s the kicker: I also want to be able to access that library remotely as well, which sounds a lot like what ZumoDrive proposes except I no longer control my data in this scenario, they do. (And no offense ZumoDrive, as good as you look internet start-ups have a whacky tendency to just disappear.)</p>
<p>So is there a way for me do to that? Something I can install on my Mac that says &#8220;treat this data from this IP address as a local volume&#8221;? I&#8217;d pay for that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I expect that one of the upsides of this current economic downturn is that for one reason or another some - perhaps many - good, creative, intelligent people will find themselves looking for work. It behooves good, creative, intelligent companies to grab such people up as quick as they can before things rebound and there&#8217;s jobs-aplenty.</p>
<p>One person currently available is <a href="http://reginald.braythwayt.com/RegBraithwaiteGH0109_en_US.pdf">Reg Braithwaite</a> whose skills as a software developer/management skills and experience I will not do justice to through my description here. You should just check out <a href="http://reginald.braythwayt.com/RegBraithwaiteGH0109_en_US.pdf">his resume</a> and then his <a href="http://github.com/raganwald">github page</a> and then go read his <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/07/brief-history-of-dangerous-ideas.html">other, now-defunct blog</a> and then google him. You&#8217;ll be impressed, I promise.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Good people help retain good people. Good people with notoriety attract good people. I have a very small “brand,” but for all that it is very specific and should not be carelessly wasted. I’m looking for the type of company where we can put “The Braithwaite Effect” to work attracting and retaining the very best people.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/f6b0ffa05615fd507cd7ebb912e639078e4e4309/2009-01-14/advertisement.md">One reason to hire me that isn’t obvious from reading my resume</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That I could, I would.</p>

<p>There is wisdom in them there words. <a href="http://www.postal-code.com/binarycode/2008/02/27/monkey-vs-donkey-fight/">Monkey-patching is (perhaps) ok</a>, but voodoo should probably be avoided at all costs and an object that can act but won&#8217;t provide a means of letting you know without actually trying it is just plain ol&#8217; voodoo. And programming voodoo is bad juju.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s my birthday and, as is inevitable with all birthdays, people ask &#8220;what would you like?&#8221; This year I&#8217;d like something a little different.</p>
<p>Since January I&#8217;ve been working with a group of fantastic people to help create <a href="http://www.dreambank.org">DreamBank</a>, a web site who&#8217;s goal - and our hope - is to alter, for the better, the way in which we give each other gifts. DreamBank is designed to allow anyone to post their goals, or their needs, or their wants in a way that allows their friends, their family, and everyone else to help them achieve their objectives. No more mis-sized socks, no more unwanted DVDs, no more soon-to-be-lost gift cards. Just a goal and the means.</p>
<p>For my birthday I&#8217;d really like if you&#8217;d head over to <a href="http://www.dreambank.org">DreamBank</a>, check out the work we&#8217;ve been doing, read about the philosophy, sign up, create a dream and give it a try.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreambank.org">http://www.dreambank.org</a></p>
<p>Many thanks to you, on my birthday.<br />
Chris</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fully support this metric: <a href='http://harpoontech.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-code-metric-destroyed-lines-of-code.html'>A New Code Metric : Destroyed Lines Of Code (DLOC)</a>. I suspect that deleting extraneous lines of code is often far, far more enjoyable than actually writing that code in the first place.</p>
<p>We all know that the first dump of code for any feature of any notable size (I&#8217;d argue somewhere above six lines of code or so) is almost never perfect. Never as concise as it could be, never as elegant. At least, that&#8217;s the case for my code anyhow. At the moment of creation this dross is offset by the acute focus of the mind that created it, juggled it, pure clarity incarnate. But as time passes and the mind drifts further and further from that moment of creation the inelegance of the code percolates to the surface while the clarity clouds and fades until eventually, one fateful day, the mind returns to that block of code and instead of resuming the juggling, it gasps a &#8220;Wtf was I doing here? And why did I do it like that?&#8221; and then &#8220;Six lines? More like three lines jackass - sha-zam!&#8221;</p>
<p>And in deleting and refactoring some beauty is regained, and the inelegance to clarity ratio decreases and the code is better, for some personal measure of &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>
<p>And in that the mind has just undertaken constructive destructive refactoring. And it is good.</p>
