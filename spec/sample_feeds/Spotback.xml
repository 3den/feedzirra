<p>The first generation of our rating and recommendation tools was primarily focused in offering better content discovery inside a specific domain, increasing pageloads and visit length. As of today, Spotback releases the next generation of its tools, helping content owners to expose their content to a wider audience and drive more traffic from other sites in the Spotback Network.</p>
<p>Since we opened our service as public beta three months ago, nearly <strong>2,000 websites</strong> chose to install our rating and recommendation tools, generating a total of <strong>more than 500,000 pageviews per day</strong>. Using our new tools, any content owner can now enjoy the benefits of being a part of this fast-growing network and promote their content throughout the net.</p>
<p>This is an example of one of the early adopters of the new Spotback widget</p>
<p><a href="http://jeffsingerphotography.blogspot.com/"><img src='http://blog.spotback.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/jeff-singer-photography-blog.JPG' alt='jeff-singer-photography-blog.JPG' /></a></p>
<p>It the lovely blog of the great photographer <b><a href="http://jeffsingerphotography.blogspot.com/">&#8220;Jeff Singer Photography Blog&#8221;</a></b>. As shown in the screenshot below, the widget also has a new look and feel and number of great new features.</p>
<p><img src='http://blog.spotback.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/being-green.JPG' alt='being-green.JPG' /></p>
<p>Another new ability (not shown on the screenshot) is the full integration of the rating with the RSS streams, allowing RSS readers to rate directly from the RSS feed.</p>
<p>If you want to get the new widget or upgrade your blog from an earlier version, simply visit <a href="http://spotback.com/joinspotbacknet/invite ">http://spotback.com/joinspotbacknet/invite </a>and create your new widget.</p>

“I’m telling you, they have to die!” he looks at me and I recognize the laser beam red in his eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s happening, man?” I smile at him, and he shoots me down with a scowl.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? The Spotbacks! They have to die!”</p>
<p>“The Spotbacks? Who are these Spotbacks?”</p>
<p>“Two brothers, the Kaufmans, developed this widget to rate the net, the whole world, all the information existing within mankind.”</p>
<p>“Rate everything? In what way?”</p>
<p>“In such a way that will determine for me, for you, for all of us, what we really love!!!” he barks and his red robe flaps with his winds of rage. “They are the beginning of technology’s world takeover!”<br />
“The beginning of the takeover?“</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Then what are you so mad about, man?” I smile at him, scratching my head.</p>
<p>“What am I so mad about? I’m mad! I’m mad because they decided to give people the power to rank who they love more.”</p>
<p>“Right!” I suddenly hear a voice behind me and turn around. “Batman,” I smile, “how you doing?”</p>
<p> “Worried to death, just like me,” I hear another voice, and smile at Spiderman hanging above us.</p>
<p>“What’s gotten into the three of you?”</p>
<p>“What’s gotten into us???” the world suddenly shudders to the voice of the Amazing Hulk, “Spotbacks!” Batman cries, stomping his foot.</p>
<p>“What about them?”</p>
<p>“They decided to let people rank which of us is the cooler.”</p>
<p>“And…?”</p>
<p>“And?” Spiderman exclaims, “And then humanity will decide which of us is the coolest! What do you think will be left for all the rest? A piece of tights? Look, look,” he cried, pulling the clothing clinging to his body, “do you know how hot it gets?”</p>
<p>“Chill, guys…isn’t it a shame…to get so upset?”</p>
<p>“I need an Advil,” the Amazing Hulk murmurs, holding his head, “I need an Advil…”</p>
<p>“Chill, man, chill…” Superman signals towards him and Batman pulls out some Advil from a pack hidden somewhere on his body.</p>
<p>“We have to stop them,” he shakes his head, troubled, while handing the pill to the Amazing Hulk.</p>
<p>“Guys, why are you acting like this? What’s with you?” I laugh, “It’s the Spotbacks, Micha and Amit just developed some widget which could help humanity, and not demolish it or censor it, but quite the opposite…the opposite…” I say, swallowing my saliva in response to the Amazing Hulk’s glaring eyes.</p>
<p>“Who is this dumbass?” his voice suddenly trembles.</p>
<p>“A friend of mine,” Superman says.</p>
<p>“And why is he here?” Spiderman asks.</p>
<p>“Dunno,” Superman shrugs.</p>
<p>“Guys, relax, Spotback is just software that helps us find what we like and need in out lives.”</p>
<p>“Spotback you say?” the Amazing Hulk mutters.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I smile.</p>
<p>“Then spot this,” Spiderman calls out, and for a minute I see black.</p>
<p>“Why did you do that?” I yell, in response to the pain in my right eye.</p>
<p>“That’s our Spot Back at you, man,” the Amazing Hulk laughs, and I close me eye, thinking how black it will be during the coming month.  Afterwards, I sit on the edge of the sidewalk, and look down at them, fighting, raging, plotting. I smile. I can’t help but think if a Spotback can drive crazy the four greatest superheroes the world has ever seen, what will they do to the way we use the Internet…<br />
