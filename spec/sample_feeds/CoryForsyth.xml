		<content type="html" xml:base="http://coryforsyth.com/2009/01/21/1202009/"><![CDATA[<p>Our day began painfully early, especially considering that we had been up until after 2 getting home from a Frightened Rabbit concert the night before.  Jenna woke me up at about 5:30, and we got the crew together and ready to go by a few minutes after 6.  I could tell the metro was going to be packed because as we walked down from Dan&#8217;s house to the Columbus Heights stop in the freezing predawn, folks kept pouring out of houses and joining us on the way there.  Little trickles of people were coming from all the side roads, accumulating at every intersection.</p>
<p>We barely missed the first metro that came by and had to wait a little anxiously as the crowd grew, and grew, and grew, before the next train arrived.  We had to push a little to fit in, and several folks pushed up behind us to get on. I didn&#8217;t have enough personal space to get my arms up so I let other people&#8217;s shoulders hold me up when the train departed.</p>
<p>At each station that we stopped at a few more people managed to squeeze on.  When we got to our destination we stepped off the train and saw&#8230;wall-to-wall people leading to the escalators and up to the turnstiles.  In DC you have to swipe your metro card on the way out and this caused a pretty serious bottleneck as people jammed up against those turnstiles and fumbled through heavy coats for their cards.</p>
<p>We were a few blocks away from our entry point, which was the Blue Gate.  Every ticket had a color that indicated which section you&#8217;d be in, and each section had a correspondingly named gate.  The blue section was one of the closer sections, well in front of the reflecting pool and maybe only about 100 yards back.  (This turned out not to matter later as we didn&#8217;t have a direct line of sight and had to watch the huge monitors like people further back, but we didn&#8217;t know that yet and were still full of Hope&copy;.)  As we got closer to our gate the crowd got thicker until we reached a t-stop near one of the silver gates and came upon a thick, nearly impenetrable wall of people waiting for the gate to open.  We had to go single file and snake our way shoulder-to-shoulder through the crowd, weaving in a curvy path through and around.  Other people joined our line as we made our way, and at one point I was a few people behind Jenna and Travis and Dan and I realized I could very easily lose them completely, even in plain sight, and next time I caught up with them I should grab my ticket from Jenna and keep it on myself from then on.</p>
<p>After about fifteen minutes curving around, we finally broke through the other side of the mass of people and could take our place at the end of the blue line.  It was wrapped around the side of some large government building, and so we were actually facing *away* from the capitol when we got in line. It wouldn&#8217;t be the last time we weren&#8217;t what was going on or if we were in the right place.  It was about 7:15am now, and the gates were supposed to open at 8.</p>
<p>Now that we were no longer moving, the biting early-morning cold really started to sink in.  The night before we had tried to buy some of those chemical hand-warmers from the CVS but were told that all the stores in the area had already sold out of them, and I was really wishing I had thought to wear more clothes.  I put the collar of my pea coat up to keep the wind out a little, and I put on my ear warmer under my hat, but the chilly air still cut right through.</p>
<p>The worst of the cold didn&#8217;t come from the air but from the ground.  We were standing on marble, and the cold from the stone seeped up through our soles.  Everyone around us who hadn&#8217;t thought to wear big thick boots was stamping their feet to keep warm.</p>
<p>[to be continued tomorrow]</p>

A good samaritan hipster couple who were walking on the street saw what was going down and the girl&#8217;s boyfriend <em>physically held the thief down</em> long enough for her to call the police and wait for them to arrive. When the fuzz arrived they arrested the thief and took my tire into custody as evidence.</p>
<p>Since that time I have been to the police station four separate times, and every time I&#8217;ve had to explain my story to the same <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799777/">J.K. Simmons</a>-looking officer who denies any knowledge of my tire and tells me to come back another time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a month and a half and I&#8217;ve finally given up. I wasn&#8217;t expecting to have a chance to ride again until March anyway, but we&#8217;ve been having 40-degree days lately so I&#8217;m going to take matters into my own hands and replace the tire at B&#8217;s Bikes this weekend.</p>

<blockquote><p>
What an astounding election! The candidates represented the first state (Delaware, home of Senator Joe Biden) and the last state (Hawaii, birthplace of Barack Obama, one of the youngest candidates in our history and first African-American candidate), the biggest state (Alaska, whose governor is Sarah Palin, the second female candidate) and the (second) smallest state (Delaware), the coldest state (Alaska) and the warmest state (Hawaii), the state &#8220;that goes from A to Z&#8221; (Arizona, home of Senator John McCain, one of our oldest candidates), the northernmost state (Alaska) and the southernmost state (Hawaii), the westernmost state (Hawaii) and an East Coast state (Delaware). And the new president-elect, Barack Obama, son of a white mother and a black father, is from a very central state, a crossroads of the nation, Illinois, that was the home of Abraham Lincoln. May this most remarkable person truly unite all the people of this great country in facing the tasks ahead. All the signs are good.

They didn&#8217;t play <a href='http://hypem.com/track/615183/The+Muslims-Nightlife'>Nightlife</a>, my favorite song, but otherwise it was a great show.  Loud, packed, gritty, and a girl spilled her shirley temple all over phil and me. Couldn&#8217;t ask for more, really.  I&#8217;m going to catch at least one more of their shows this weekend.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://coryforsyth.com/2008/10/21/creating-dynamic-adium-away-messages-with-ruby-and-applescript/"><![CDATA[<p>I was messing around with <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> the other day and noticed that if you right-click while writing a custom away message a context menu comes up with an option to &#8220;Insert Script >&#8221;.  Any time I see a script in use somewhere, I wonder what interesting thing I could do with Ruby.  So, since it&#8217;s that time of year, I created a script that shows Obama&#8217;s current lead (or deficit) in the polls on a state-by-state basis.  An example dynamically created message is: &#8220;In WA, Obama currently leads by 10.3. [source: RealClearPolitics ].&#8221;</p>
<p>I learned the nuts and bolts of how to add these scripts from <a href='http://schinckel.net/2005/08/15/adium-plugin-scripts/'>Paint the Tiger, Carve the Dragon</a>.  Basically, you need to create an Applescript that has a &#8220;substitute()&#8221; function, put it in &#8220;/Applications/Adium.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/System Statistics.AdiumScripts/&#8221;, and then edit the Info.plist file (at the same path) to contain the necessary information to tell Adium what to call your script, when to invoke it (what &#8220;%_&#8221; string to use), and the filename of the script.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to do some network calls and some fairly complicated parsing of those results, I delegated the heavy lifting to a Ruby script and had the Applescript simply execute that ruby script as a shell script.  To use the script yourself, unzip <a href='http://coryforsyth.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/politics-in-your-adium.zip' title='politics in your adium'>this file</a>.  It contains an applescript called Politics.scpt and a directory called &#8220;politics&#8221; that includes the &#8220;politics.rb&#8221; ruby script.  Copy both the applescript and the &#8220;politics&#8221; directory to &#8220;/Applications/Adium.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/System Statistics.AdiumScripts/&#8221;.<br />
You may want to try running the politics.rb file directly to ensure that it will work and you have all the dependencies you need.  If anything&#8217;s awry, you&#8217;re probably missing the ruby gems hpricot or open-uri.  The commands &#8220;sudo gem install hpricot&#8221; and &#8220;sudo gem install open-uri&#8221; should fix that.</p>
<p>Then edit the Info.plist file in the above directory, adding the text:</p>
<pre>
&lt;dict&gt;
   &lt;key&gt;File&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;string&gt;Politics&lt;/string&gt;
   &lt;key&gt;Keyword&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;string&gt;%_politics&lt;/string&gt;
   &lt;key&gt;Title&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;string&gt;Obama Politics update&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
</pre>
<p>Now, after you restart Adium, you should have the &#8220;Obama Politics update&#8221; option in your &#8220;Insert Script&#8221; menu when writing your custom away message. Just typing in <b>%_politics</b> directly should work as well.  I don&#8217;t know how to control Adium&#8217;s refresh rate on the script, it seems to refresh every 15-30 seconds on its own.</p>

<h2>Chris Wanstrath, parse tree</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://errtheblog.com/posts/60-sake-bomb'>Sake</a>, rake tasks that you can use between different projects.</li>
<li><a href='http://cheat.errtheblog.com/'>Cheat</a> &#8212; command line interface for looking up documentation. Like &#8216;man&#8217; for ruby and rails methods.</li>
<li><a href='http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3588'>Ruby2Ruby</a> (I can&#8217;t find the official homepage, that&#8217;s a placeholder).  Looks very cool, but I am not 100% sure what it does other than self-document (?) your ruby code with ruby code. I have to play with this to figure it out.</li>

<h2>Ryan Davis, Hurting Code For Fun and Profit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code-writing ability increases non-linearly when you become a Ruby sadist/asceticist</li>
<li>coined a new term: menturbating/mentorbating</li>
<li>&#8220;Introspection-driven development&#8221;</li>
<li>self-improvement: read 1 nerd book/month (12x the industry avg). <a href='http://c2.com'> c2.com </a>, read 10-20ish smart blogs</li>
<li>ignorance is not bliss.  <a href='http://www.zenspider.com/RWD/Thoughts/Inept.html'>NYT article by Erica Goode</a></li>
<li>wtf, coding horror and other idiot forums, trim the blogs in your newsreader, focus</li>
<li>important/not-important, urgent/not-urgent.  these form a quadrant. push towards important. the not-important and not-urgent stuff are useful at times, too, for fighting burnout. via 7 habits of highly effective people by covey.  &#8220;do you want to be right, or do you want to be effective?&#8221;</li>
<li>study something non-coding-oriented.  push yourself. write more code, lots of it. junk code. write stuff to figure something out. quantity can be greater than quality (sometimes)</li>
<li>???The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork<br />

<li>vlad and image_science &#8212; (hate of complex code)</li>
<li>use feedback. ask for it. listen to it. feed the feedback back. constantly refine.</li>
<li>find your balance. between 0-100% action and 0-100% thought is your sweet spot. find that balance an dyou&#8217;ll be most of effective.</li>
<li>ryan hates inject &#8212; why? (see the mailing list)</li>
<li>heckle: runs your tests and mutates your implementations to verify that your tests are good. if youre mutated tests still pass after mutation, you missed an edge case</li>
<li>enjoy hurting bad code and you&#8217;ll have less of it over time. eschew complexity.</li>

<h2>Paul Dix, Collective Intelligence</h2>
<ul>
<li>Slides are up at <a href='http://pauldix.blogs.com/pauldix/goruco/collective_intelligence.pdf'>paul&#8217;s blog</a></li>
<li>explicit versus implicit data. implicit happens as a result of other actions. scrobbling is an example. explicit makes you make choices (give ratings/grades/stars to things, etc.)</li>
<li>types of recommendations &#8212; content-, user- and item-based.  content is like other content, users are like other users, items are like other items.</li>
<li>basic strategy: map data to a euclidean spaces, calculate similarity using a metric, and use similarities to recommend. represent the data as vectors.</li>
<li>(I discovered <a href='http://www.confreaks.com/'>confreaks</a> just now. cool.  I think goruco vids will be up there later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Merb</h2>
<ul>
<li>Merb looks really cool. I got tired of taking notes here so I just sat back and watched his talk.  Next personal project I do is going to be in Merb.</li>

My favorite song of theirs is <a href='http://coryforsyth.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/believeaword.mp3' title='VHS or Beta'>Can&#8217;t Believe a Single Word </a> (thx, <a href='http://heartachewithhardwork.blogspot.com/2007/10/hey-you-in-middle-of-night-with-lights.html'>Heartache With Hard Word</a>).
