&lt;p&gt;...Napster [is] planning on offering its complete catalog of more than 6 million tracks in the unprotected [DRM-free] MP3 format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Today, with the launch of version 4.5 of the software and store, that announcement becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Although digital music stores such as eMusic, Amazon MP3, and even Napster itself already had MP3s on offer before this point, the collective catalogs of all three didn't even come near the volume of tracks you can find in the entire Napster library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge day for digital music, as all four major labels and thousands upon thousands of indies are represented in the store, and every track will be available at the standard 99-cent price point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">
&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2008/05/the-people-united-will-never-be-defeated"&gt;Marc Canter&lt;/a&gt; titles a new blog post, calling for revolution in the virtual streets, &lt;em&gt;"The people united will never be defeated."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which presents a great opportunity for a late Saturday night music recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;em&gt;"The people united will never be defeated"&lt;/em&gt; is a translation of "El pueblo unido jamás será vencido", originally from mid-century Colombian politician Jorge Gaitán, who was, inevitably, assassinated.  It later became a song written by Sergio Ortega and performed by the Chilean group Quilapayún, and was used in various political protest movements in South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's not why I'm writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the great contemporary American composer Frederic Rzewski composed a set of 36 variations for solo piano under the name &lt;em&gt;"The people united will never be defeated."&lt;/em&gt;  His composition is probably the preeminent American work for solo piano in the 20th century, and is likely to stand over time as a peer to Beethoven's similar &lt;em&gt;"Diabelli Variations"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are currently -- despite everything you hear -- in the golden age of classical music, there are several modern and complete recordings of Rzewski's work available on CD.  The two I recommend are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000R3N?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=marandsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000000R3N"&gt;American pianist Stephen Drury's version.&lt;/a&gt;  His CD includes the original song itself followed by the complete piano work, and is an excellent performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IXWM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=marandsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000IXWM"&gt;Canadian pianist Marc-André Hamelin's version.&lt;/a&gt;  Hamelin is probably the best pianist of his generation, and so anything he records is worth buying, this included.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are recorded in fully modern sound and are recommended for anyone who likes music, even if you don't think you like modern classical music.  Just sit back with a glass of your favorite wine or Scotch, and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy listening!&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;First, I'm very happy to say that &lt;strong&gt;Ning &lt;a href="http://blog.ning.com/2008/05/may-product-roadmap-whats-next.html"&gt;will be rolling out&lt;/a&gt; our formal production support for &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/open-social-a-n.html"&gt;Open Social&lt;/a&gt; in June&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/11/breaking-news-n.html"&gt;the news&lt;/a&gt; at the time, Open Social is a standard way, sponsored by Google, to build new features ("gadgets") and/or plug those features into social networks all over the web, including social networks on Ning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Ning has had &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/11/breaking-news-n.html"&gt;beta versions&lt;/a&gt; of Open Social running for six months now so we're excited to be able to now provide Open Social in production to all of our Network Creators and users.  &lt;strong&gt;Open Social will be available within all 265,490 social networks already running on Ning, as well as the 10,000+ new social networks being created on Ning every week now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I'd like to discuss Google's new &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/home/moreinfo"&gt;Friend Connect&lt;/a&gt; initiative and how we plan to support it at Ning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We at Ning think that Friend Connect is a great idea, and has huge potential to make Open Social even more functional and widely available for a broad swath of our users and Network Creators on Ning and throughout the web.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the last couple days, there's been some confusion around the idea that perhaps Friend Connect is somehow competitive with Ning -- which is odd, because we don't think so and because we think it's obvious that it's not.  So let me start by first explaining what Friend Connect is, and then how Ning is going to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friend Connect is a mechanism by which Open Social gadgets can be published and used not just &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a social network but also &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; that social network.&lt;/strong&gt;  When an Open Social gadget shows up elsewhere on the web, via Friend Connect, the friend data and social context comes with the Open Social gadget from its origin social network -- and that origin social network might be a network on Ning or a large walled garden network like MySpace or Orkut, and that Open Social gadget might be embedded on any page anywhere on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, Friend Connect one-ups Flash widgets.  Many social networks and other content hubs today publish Flash widgets like video players and music players that get embedded in pages all over the web.  &lt;strong&gt;Friend Connect is a mechanism that provides the embedding capability for Open Social gadgets to be used all throughout the web&lt;/strong&gt; -- with the added benefit that with a Friend Connect-enabled Open Social gadget, the user gets her social context anywhere she goes, which isn't the case with a typical Flash widget.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as you are hopefully aware, &lt;a href="http://ning.com/"&gt;Ning&lt;/a&gt; is a service for &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/07/why-ning.html"&gt;creating your own social network for anything&lt;/a&gt; -- with your choice of features, your design, and your members, customized however you want it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;From a strategy standpoint, we want to enable maximum flow both &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;/em&gt; Ning networks and the rest of the web.  It should be as easy as possible for users to get &lt;strong&gt;from elsewhere on the web into a Ning network&lt;/strong&gt;, and likewise as easy as possible to flow &lt;strong&gt;from a Ning network to anywhere else on the web&lt;/strong&gt; -- and ideally, while taking their social context with them.  We think this makes strategic sense for two key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it's good for users, and whatever is good for users is good for a service like Ning.  We think that's obvious.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, you don't get lots of flow &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; anything on the web without having lots of flow &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; to the broader web.&lt;/strong&gt;  We think that's also obvious -- you are compromising your own product to your self-inflicted detriment if you're not making it as easy as possible for activity to flow out as well as in.  Google of course itself illustrates this -- Google's primary business, search, generates revenue purely by having people &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt; Google, by clicking on an ad -- and that's no accident, and there is no shortage of people who flow &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Google as a result.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we have from the start published Flash widgets and more recently Facebook apps that any Ning user can embed elsewhere on the web or out to their Facebook page -- to extend content and functions from a Ning network out onto the web.  This has obviously been a good thing to do because users love it, and because those widgets and Facebook apps link right back to their origin Ning networks and drive traffic back &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; even while propagating content and functionality &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Ning, Friend Connect is simply a new and better way to do the same thing with Open Social gadgets -- in both directions: out and in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We will support Friend Connect in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every network on Ning will be able to be an Open Social origin social network&lt;/strong&gt; -- pushing out Open Social gadgets to anywhere else on the web that carry with them the social context and friends data from their origin Ning network.  So, for example, the members of a backpacking social network on Ning can still interact as friends on any third-party backpacking web site, by publishing an Open Social gadget out from their Ning network onto that third-party web site.  &lt;strong&gt;In short, people will be able to flow more easily from Ning to many other web sites without losing the social context of their Ning networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every network on Ning will of course be able to contain Open Social gadgets published out from other social networks on the Internet via Friend Connect.&lt;/strong&gt;  So, for example, a group of friends on MySpace who all enjoy cooking will be able to travel from MySpace to a cooking-specific social network on Ning, via any Friend Connect-enabled Open Social gadget published from MySpace into that Ning network.  &lt;strong&gt;In short, people will be able to flow more easily from other social networks and walled gardens into Ning social networks without losing the social context from those other networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ning's role remains the same -- to be the easiest, most powerful, and most widely used way for anyone to create your own social network for anything.&lt;/strong&gt;  Friend Connect then makes social networks on Ning more powerful and more relevant for a larger base of users to do more on the web, to flow out and to flow in -- &lt;strong&gt;a good thing for those users and a good thing for us&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;A dual-class stock structure means that a company has two different classes of common stock.  Each class of stock has the same economic ownership of the company, yet different voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical scenario, &lt;strong&gt;Class A&lt;/strong&gt; shares have a &lt;strong&gt;single vote per share&lt;/strong&gt;, whereas &lt;strong&gt;Class B&lt;/strong&gt; shares have &lt;strong&gt;10 votes per share&lt;/strong&gt;, for any shareholder vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Using this mechanism, for example, the Class B shareholders might only own 20% of the company in economic terms but have a clear majority voting position relative to the Class A shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Class A shareholders have shares labeled with the earlier letter in the alphabet, but &lt;strong&gt;Class B shareholders control the company&lt;/strong&gt; -- in stark contrast to the more normal single-class stock structure which is more classically democratic: "one share, one vote".  Since Class B shareholders will typically be some set of founding management or founding investors in the company, in practice the presence of a dual-class stock structure means that &lt;strong&gt;the founders control the company&lt;/strong&gt; and can overrule all other shareholders on a wide range of issues, including if and when to sell the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Both public and private companies can have dual-class stock structures, but the controversy around dual-class stock structures is usually confined to public companies, due to the presence of public shareholders.  And so I will focus purely on public companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I used to be an absolutist against dual-class stock structures&lt;/strong&gt; -- I used to believe that dual-class stock structures were obviously a bad idea, that the democratic single-class approach of "one share, one vote" was more fair to public investors and more likely to lead to a healthy company in the long run, since total founder control of a public company can allow the founders to overrule normal market forces and the interests of their public shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact, practically all investor advocates and shareholder activists agree with that stance -- dual-class stock structures are at the top of the list of techniques that entrenched managers can use to foil the normal market discipline of a public stock, and to frustrate outside public shareholders who can easily become disenfranchised even when they have majority ownership of a company... with a long-run outcome similar to the kind of insularity and inbreeding you find in royal families.  These days, the New York Times Company has of course become the poster child for entrenched bad management operating against the interests of their public shareholders due to its dual-class stock structure -- how could anyone possibly be in favor of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And on the face of it, a dual-class stock structure simply seems unfair -- how can someone own part of something but have a tenth of the rights of someone else who owns the same amount?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 15 years in the technology industry, though, I have done a complete 180-degree turn on the topic&lt;/strong&gt; -- with some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I come not to bury dual-class stock structures, but to praise them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I now believe that dual-class stock structures are a great idea for a technology company that is in the process of going public, under the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The key leaders of the company -- typically the founders -- who will own the controlling Class B shares, are also major economic shareholders in the company.  They own a significant portion of the company and are therefore highly incented to maximize the value of the company over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The key leaders of the company who own the controlling Class B shares have a long-term goal of building a major franchise, and the commitment required to execute against that goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The controlling Class B shareholders have a commitment to treat Class A shareholders fairly and equally in all respects other than voting power.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;All public shareholders understand what they are getting into up front -- no bait and switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key to the whole thing is shared goals&lt;/strong&gt; -- particularly the shared goal of long-term value creation, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; the creation of a &lt;strong&gt;long-term franchise&lt;/strong&gt;, the kind of franchise that can require 10 years or longer to build.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;With such goals, I now believe the interests of public shareholders will often be &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; served by ceding voting control to the founders and key leaders of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This is a provocative statement, so let me back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In practice, the world at large, the markets in which companies operate, and Wall Street in particular, throw up all kinds of short- and medium-term noise in the face of every public company, all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact, my sense is that the level of such noise is steadily increasing for about a dozen different reasons, including but not limited to the proliferation of hedge funds, buyout funds, arbitrage funds, corporate raiders, shareholder activists, shareholder representation firms like ISS, sell-side analysts, cable television financial news, financial web sites, Internet message boards, online stock trading, increased consumer interest in stocks and markets, and visibly shortening investor time horizons across the entire landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;When you are running a public company, here are some of the things that get routinely thrown at you that have practically nothing to do with building a long-term franchise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock market booms and busts&lt;/strong&gt; -- the stock market is bipolar; it doesn't matter what finance academics say about efficient markets, everyone knows greed and fear whipsaw the market around all the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic booms and busts&lt;/strong&gt; -- e.g. this ridiculous credit crisis and real estate fiasco.  Modern economies are apparently characterized by one self-inflicted crisis after another.  And even when you're not directly affected by a particular crisis, if you're running a public company, you're probably going to be indirectly affected, often for no good reason aside from the universe's desire to inflict collateral damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedge funds aggressively short-term buying and shorting stocks for the quick pop, and often spreading malicious and untrue rumors along the way.&lt;/strong&gt;  I'm no Patrick Byrne, but every CEO of a public company regularly contends with just &lt;em&gt;silly&lt;/em&gt; rumors all the time that are obviously being spread by someone talking their book, or rather lying their book -- and SEC oversight of such market manipulation is almost completely absent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraged buyout funds that make apparently attractive buyout offers financed with massive amounts of debt, and then strip-mine the company&lt;/strong&gt; for fees and dividends before sending it back out into the public markets weaker than before.  These guys are wonderfully skilled at paying themselves; on average, their franchise-building skills are questionable at best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate raiders of various stripes.&lt;/strong&gt;  I'll certainly grant that corporate raiders as a category have probably been good for capitalism as compared to the clubby Fortune 500 status quo of the 1970's, but when a raider gets his hooks into &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; public company, he's only in it for the quick pop, and he'll agitate to get it acquired as fast as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostile takeovers&lt;/strong&gt; -- which may provide a quick payoff to current investors but which definitively bring to an end any opportunity to build a long-term franchise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intense quarterly earnings guessing game&lt;/strong&gt; that you end up playing even if you don't want to -- even if you refuse to issue guidance, and perhaps &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if you refuse to issue guidance, in which case Wall Street just goes ahead and sets expectations for you without consulting you.  The vertiginous stock drop that follows "missing your numbers" can actually damage your company -- you wouldn't believe how many customers check Yahoo Finance before each sales call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial journalists&lt;/strong&gt; -- who can be outstanding writers with journalism degrees from the best schools, and in many cases know almost nothing about the companies they are covering or the products those companies make, which does not keep them from writing all kinds of nonsense.  High-quality business journalism is distinctly the exception, not the rule; every CEO knows it, and the noise from inaccurate bad press can again actually damage your company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;And then, finally, pure good old fashioned &lt;strong&gt;company-specific fluctuations&lt;/strong&gt; -- sometimes things are going well, sometimes they're going poorly.  If you're building a franchise, that's OK, and even to be expected; you just need to power through the rough patch.  However, if you're subject to short-term market demands, a rough patch can kill your dreams amazingly quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;All of these things can meaningfully interfere with &lt;strong&gt;long-term&lt;/strong&gt; value creation, particularly if you are trying to build a &lt;strong&gt;long-term franchise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The huge advantage of a dual-class stock structure is that it lets the company's core management simply ignore most of this stuff and stay focused on the long-term goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;What's the ideal situation for a public shareholder with a long-term time horizon?  &lt;strong&gt;To invest in a company whose leaders are highly motivated to build long-term value&lt;/strong&gt; -- to grow the value of the company 10x or 100x or 1,000x -- not flip it to the first interested acquirer for a quick pop, or even the fifth, or the tenth.  &lt;strong&gt;And therefore to invest in a company whose leaders have the ability to pursue building for the long term&lt;/strong&gt;, versus getting constantly compromised by short-term market noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, if you listen closely, you can hear the howls of outrage.  They are saying, &lt;em&gt;how can shareholders expect to countenance being effectively powerless?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course the answer is alignment of goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Investors that have short-term goals, or even medium-term goals, shouldn't invest in public companies with dual-class stock structures.  Remember, I'm presuming no bait and switch.  You are always free to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; invest in any company for any reason, including this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you're an investor with a long-term time horizon, you will, I believe, be best served investing in companies with a similar long-term time horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of taking this position is that I get to roll out the big gun: &lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffett similarly advocates dual-class stock structures for precisely this reason&lt;/strong&gt;, and puts his money where his mouth is -- he famously has been a long-term investor in the Washington Post Company, for example, which has a dual-class stock structure that gives the Graham family total control, and which has been a stellar long-term investment for Berkshire Hathaway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Now, dual-class stock structures have been customary in the media industry for a long time, but are relatively new to the technology industry.  The most prominent example of a public technology company with a dual-class stock structure is of course Google, whose structure puts total voting control of the company in the hands of Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt.    Corresponding to that, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have made a 20-year commitment to Google, and are clearly pursuing the goal of building a long-term franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, shareholders haven't exactly been scared off from investing in Google as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If anything -- and I haven't done a statistical analysis of this, but just look at the charts and the stock prices of this decade -- Google may actually be getting a premium in the market due to its dual-class share structure, as investors are able to make a clean bet on long-term value creation, and they know that the core team can just put their heads down and power through any short-term nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;strong&gt;Google has changed the rules on this topic&lt;/strong&gt; -- I think many technology companies, certainly the ones with high potential, that go public over the next decade will have dual-class stock structures, due in part to the Google precedent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;On to some practical questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't companies with dual-class stock structures risk limiting their access to capital if they are only attracting long-term investors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, but again, Google is a clear counterexample.  You can hardly say it's been starved for capital.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, I would say that this question reflects the fact that companies with dual-class stock structures are still subject to market discipline.  If the market overall doesn't like the dual-stock structure, it can refuse to provide capital to those companies, and instead provide that capital to companies with shorter-term objectives and more outside shareholder control.  But I don't predict that will happen, and I would be willing to bet my own company on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Viewed systemically, dual-class stock structures are an alternative governance model that can compete in the open market for capital with other governance models.  Capital will flow appropriately.  All is good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you apply this to the drama unfolding around Microsoft and Yahoo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Well, clearly, if Jerry Yang and David Filo had dual-class-powered voting control of Yahoo, the whole situation there would be playing out very differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would have been forced to negotiate a purely friendly deal from the very start, and at a price that would have caught Jerry and David's attention from the start.  Hostile threats would have been meaningless.  Had a deal gone down, it would have been on Jerry and David's terms, and &lt;em&gt;the premium might have been even higher&lt;/em&gt; than a normal process would generate, since Jerry and David would have had the perfect walkaway option: &lt;em&gt;we're not selling, and there is no appeal -- pay up or shut up&lt;/em&gt;.  And the company could have been entirely focused on current operations the whole time -- no distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the outside shareholders?  Several of Yahoo's largest outside shareholders -- including one who owns 16% of the company, four times the amount Jerry himself owns -- are in the national press tonight saying, &lt;em&gt;we are furious Yahoo didn't sell for $34/share when Microsoft was already offering $33/share&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer: in the alternate scenario with a dual-stock structure and founder control, those outside shareholders would not have invested in Yahoo in the first place, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; they believed Yahoo had a valid plan for long-term value creation and building a franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If, in that alternate scenario, investors didn't believe Yahoo had a valid plan for long-term value creation, then that's another matter.  There would be no excuse for that.  But that would be a very different problem that would apply regardless of stock structure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In point of fact, many of Yahoo's largest shareholders today are also, or have been in the past, major Google shareholders.  Clearly Google's dual-class structure didn't scare them or their peers off at any point I could see -- instead, Google shareholders seem delighted to be aligned with a core team that has the control to execute a long-term plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the kicker: it's not like outside shareholders in Yahoo, even though they own over 70% economic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; voting control in the company, can just make the company do whatever they want -- as you can see from all their frustration in the press tonight.  Sure, the outside shareholders as a group will ultimately get whatever they want, up to and including a sale to Microsoft, but they may have to put up a significant fight to do so, and that fight may require a significant amount of time and effort, with significant opportunity cost.  And along the way, the process has been and will be characterized by confusion, ambiguity, and uncertainty.  The whole thing is clearly a massive distraction to any form of long-term value creation to the point where even Microsoft believes Yahoo is risking damaging its long-term prospects by reacting to Microsoft's hostile public bid.  So it's hard for me to see how a single-class share structure is nirvana for anyone in a situation like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what about the New York Times Company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it is true that the New York Times Company and similar failing newspaper companies -- most of them, except for the Washington Post Company with its superior diversification -- with dual-class stock structures are not exactly good investments today, since their entrenched management teams can fight off shareholder activists and hostile takeovers indefinitely while riding their declining franchises straight into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, it's not like you couldn't have seen it coming.  Every investor in any declining dual-stock media company today knew they were buying into that stock structure and did it with their eyes open.  And any investor still holding stock in such a company has been aware of the Internet for 15 years and has been able to track the performance of the company's management team in dealing with the Internet over that entire time.  Certainly it's possible to be delusional about your investment and think that recovery is right around the corner, but you can't blame the stock structure for that delusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, the New York Times Company had its dual-class stock structure for decades, and for much of that time, ordinary investors would have done very well to own its shares.  It just so happens that the wrenching technology shift that is causing so much trouble coincided with a generation of managers who are unprepared to deal with it.  That's life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the fate of the dual-stock media companies has a lot more to do with the "media company" part of it and a lot less to do with the "dual-stock" part of it.  The only investors mad about the dual-stock part -- well, the non-delusional ones -- are the ones who want the short-term stock pop from a sale to Rupert Murdoch.  And those are not the investors you want if you are trying to build a franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your recommendation to technology companies that are going public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Strongly consider implementing a dual-class stock structure, but only under the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The founders are committed to run the company for the long term and want to build a real franchise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The founders are also major economic owners of the company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The founders have an absolute commitment to treat all other shareholders fairly, and to consider themselves entirely in the same boat economically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;All public shareholders starting with the IPO know exactly what they are getting into -- no bait and switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, a dual-class stock structure is not only an outstanding idea -- &lt;strong&gt;I think, for our industry, it may be the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I discuss what I believe are some unspoken concerns that weigh on the decisions both Microsoft and Yahoo are making during this &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/04/if-microsoft-go.html"&gt;very exciting&lt;/a&gt; takeover battle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Quick status update, largely derived from the excellent &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/home/us"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; and its role as official public go-between:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Various forms of backchannel communication and price negotiation have been happening between the Microsoft and Yahoo teams this week -- including via the press.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo still disagree on price -- Microsoft is at about $33/share and Yahoo is holding out for about $36/share, maybe more -- and probably other issues, some of which I discuss in this post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft is threatening to launch its first truly hostile volley tomorrow unless the Yahoo board agrees to whatever deal is on the table now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yahoo is still working hard to convince its institutional investors -- who control the company's ultimate destiny -- that it can thrive standalone.  Most notably, Yahoo is apparently close to an ad pact with Google that could significantly boost Yahoo's independent revenue and margins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Now, reading a lot of the press coverage, you would think that the current standoff is all about Yahoo's desire to stay independent, plus price.  I think that misses the unspoken and quite complex issues that are likely bedeviling the boards of both companies as they wargame the various scenarios that could play out from here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;First, I think there is a very big and very real nonobvious concern that is a major roadblock to Yahoo accepting a Microsoft offer at almost any price:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deal could be negotiated and announced and then fail to close&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this scenario to Yahoo would be devastating, and it very well might happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Big mergers and acquisitions, particularly among public companies, &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; among public companies that have large shares of their respective markets, can take &lt;strong&gt;a year or more between the day the deal is signed and announced, to the day the deal is actually executed and closed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;During that year plus, all kinds of things can happen that could cause the deal to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo will have to get approval from various US regulatory agencies, including some combination of the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.&lt;/strong&gt;  This approval process will likely be rigorous, due to both companies' large market shares and because of Microsoft's historical antitrust issues.  The US government could disallow the merger entirely, like &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982905,00.html?promoid=googlep"&gt;when Microsoft tried to buy Intuit&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990's, or impose conditions on the merger that would render it infeasible, and &lt;strong&gt;the deal could collapse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo will also, as global companies, presumably need to get approval in other jurisdictions -- certainly the European Union.&lt;/strong&gt;  The EU is currently harsher on these issues, and on Microsoft in particular, than the US government.  If the EU refuses to approve the merger, or imposes various adverse conditions on it, &lt;strong&gt;the deal could collapse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft shareholders could revolt.&lt;/strong&gt;  Opinions among the Microsoft employee ranks, executive team, and shareholder base vary wildly on the pros and cons of this takeover.  Microsoft stock has been flat for years.  A shareholder revolt could cause all kinds of changes at Microsoft, and &lt;strong&gt;the deal could collapse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The broader economy could cave in and we could enter a serious recession.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/"&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; think that's fairly likely.  If that happens, it could significantly change all kinds of assumptions that are built into the business rationale for this takeover, and &lt;strong&gt;the deal could collapse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft could simply get cold feet for its own reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;  Perhaps during the closing process it discovers new information about Yahoo and decides the deal is a really bad idea.  A conspiracy theorist might even say that Microsoft could choose to walk away at the last minute in order to permanently and deliberately cripple Yahoo -- and such a conspiracy theorist could point to a few almost-mergers in Microsoft's history that could justify such a fear.  I am &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; saying that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am such a conspiracy theorist, but in all seriousness I bet there are at least a couple of them on Yahoo's board right now.  In such scenarios, &lt;strong&gt;the deal could collapse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, an acquisition target tries to wrap the merger agreement as tightly as possible to prevent any scenario where the deal collapses.  For example, one can specify a large &lt;strong&gt;breakup fee&lt;/strong&gt;, which the acquiror would have to pay to the target.  In a merger like this, the breakup fee could be in the billions of dollars.  And of course &lt;strong&gt;litigation&lt;/strong&gt; is reasonably likely in the wake of a deal collapse, especially if one side believes the other side has explicitly violated a binding contract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of those protections actually protect Yahoo all that well in the event that the deal collapses because it is disallowed by a government.  And further, none of those protections actually do that much to protect Yahoo all that well even if the deal collapses for other reasons.  Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The minute a merger agreement is signed, an enormous amount of focus, time, and effort at the target company is redirected towards the implications of the merger.&lt;/strong&gt;  Legally both companies are supposed to continue to operate as fully independent companies with independent strategies until the merger closes, but in practice, a lot of people in the target company are going to be highly preoccupied -- whether with formal roles in integration planning, or just due to the general distraction and anxiety that would be prompted in the halls at Yahoo at the prospect of actually being merged into Microsoft.  It is extraordinarily difficult for a management team at such a time to keep an employee base &lt;strong&gt;focused on the standalone business&lt;/strong&gt; -- in fact, I think it's &lt;strong&gt;basically impossible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;So imagine what happens if the deal is signed, a significant percentage of Yahoo's internal bandwidth over the next 12 months refocuses onto the implications of the merger, and the deal collapses.  &lt;strong&gt;Yahoo would be simultaneously behind in many of the key initiatives it would have normally pursued to be competitive as a standalone company, and highly disorganized, fragmented, and demoralized for the Microsoft-less road ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the deal collapse triggers a big breakup fee -- suppose $3 billion in breakup fee cash drops into Yahoo's lap.  So what?  A traumatized corporate victim of &lt;em&gt;merger interruptus&lt;/em&gt; is going to have far larger problems than cash, even a large amount of cash, can fix.  Same with a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are other things that Microsoft could do to offset these concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing Microsoft could do is execute a commercial agreement with Yahoo simultaneous with a merger agreement.  The commercial agreement would require Microsoft to &lt;strong&gt;shut down its own Internet efforts and instead use Yahoo's -- completely independent of the merger.&lt;/strong&gt;  Microsoft Search would shut down and Microsoft would point all of its users at Yahoo Search, and so on for all of the various overlapping product lines.  Yahoo would of course share revenue with Microsoft in return.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This would almost completely protect Yahoo from all of the collapsed deal scenarios.  Even if the deal collapses, Yahoo still has an enormously valuable commercial contract to be Microsoft's de facto Internet arm -- in essence, that contract is Yahoo's compensation for taking on the risk of the merger going through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see why Microsoft wouldn't want to agree to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the Yahoo board may be simply trying to get Microsoft to pay a higher price than even Yahoo thinks their company is worth, in order to offset this risk.  There obviously would be a price that would be so good that the merger close risk would be worth taking.  I'm not sure what that price is, I'm not sure whether Yahoo's institutional shareholders are willing to hold out for it, and I'm not sure whether Microsoft will be willing to pay it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But we're probably going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is another, related, enormous issue in Microsoft's mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;That is the issue of &lt;strong&gt;timing of the regulatory approval process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If the entire merger could be approved and closed before the new US president takes office in January 2009, that would be wonderful for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's one of the reasons why Microsoft made their offer when they did -- in January 2008, a full year before the US presidential handover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that's one of the reasons Microsoft is so frustrated with Yahoo's apparent sluggishness -- dragging this into May at the very earliest for a negotiated deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; think that's one of the reasons why Yahoo has been so apparently sluggish -- Yahoo is probably thinking that the longer this gets dragged out, the less likely the deal could be approved before the US presidential handover, and therefore the less likely Microsoft is going to consider it a clean deal, and the less likely Microsoft is going to want to go through with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Because just like Yahoo is worried about the consequences if the deal falls through -- so is Microsoft, one would imagine, for many of the same reasons.  &lt;em&gt;Merger interruptus&lt;/em&gt; bites both ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the big deal with the US presidential handover?&lt;/strong&gt;  The Bush administration is known to be quite friendly to large companies, large mergers, and Microsoft.  Any Democratic administration would probably be notably more hostile to this kind of merger than the current regime.  And even a McCain administration might have different views from the current government -- who knows?  That very uncertainty is the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome of the arrival of a new US administration is that a merger like this certainly won't become &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to be approved, and will possibly, or probably, become &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other implications one can draw from this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;One is that Microsoft probably would have been willing to pay more for a friendly deal early in this process, when there was more time to get the deal closed before January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo may have operated against its own best interest in getting the optimum friendly price by delaying so long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Yahoo may be pushing the timing out so far that Microsoft will become increasingly disincented to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps this is why Microsoft hasn't yet gone fully hostile -- they don't want to risk prolonging the approval process, and a hostile takeover will certainly take longer than a friendly one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And, correspondingly, if Microsoft does go hostile, it will be a very real expression of Microsoft's &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do this deal despite considerable risk that a new US administration, particularly a Democratic one, would not permit it to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;More to come!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen extensive press coverage of Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo over the last few months, including notably excellent coverage from &lt;a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/"&gt;Silicon Alley Insider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/home/us"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I have not seen a detailed analysis of how a full hostile takeover might play out -- the kind of analysis that you would be receiving if you were a Microsoft or Yahoo board member.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked a pair of expert corporate attorneys -- Michael Sullivan and Ed Deibert at &lt;a href="http://www.howardrice.com/"&gt;Howard Rice Nemerovski Canady Falk and Rabkin&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco -- to work up such an analysis.  What follows is their take blended with my commentary.  (Any factual errors have been caused by my edits to their work.  This is complex stuff -- if you are a corporate attorney or investment banker and notice any errors, please email me: pmarcablog (at) gmail (dot) com.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, a wrapup of events to date:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that Microsoft has offered to acquire Yahoo for 50% cash and 50% Microsoft stock.  Given Microsoft's current trading price of $29.83 -- which is a little lower than when this all started -- the current offer value works out to $29.68 per Yahoo share.  (You can track this day by day via &lt;a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/"&gt;Silicon Alley Insider&lt;/a&gt;'s excellent &lt;a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/2/introducing_the_sai_msftyhoo_bid_calculator"&gt;bid calculator&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo stock closed on Friday at $26.80 per share.  The difference between that and the Microsoft offer price is $2.88, or about a 9.7% discount to the offer.  That discount reflects the stock market's collective estimate of the odds of the deal not happening -- or, alternately, of Microsoft's stock falling further if the deal proceeds, or, alternately, of Microsoft lowering its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the original offer -- January 31 -- Yahoo stock was trading at $19.18 per share.  Microsoft's offer at that time represented a 62% premium.  Since then, both the S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ indices are roughly flat, so it's reasonable to assume that if Microsoft pulls its offer now, Yahoo's stock will revert to approximately $19.18 per share -- perhaps a little higher if shareholders are more encouraged by Yahoo's standalone prospects now versus before, and perhaps a little lower if shareholders are less encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago, Microsoft set a deadline of last Saturday for the Yahoo board to accept its offer.  Yahoo's board did not agree to the deal.  In Microsoft's words: "If we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks, we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders, including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the Yahoo! board."  Microsoft has also threatened to lower the offer price, but on the other hand Microsoft has also said in recent days that it might walk away from the deal.  Microsoft also insists it will not raise its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;External factors are more or less the same as they were when the bid was originally made.  There have been no alternate bids for Yahoo from any other companies in any form.  Microsoft has signalled weakness in their own Internet business and lowered their 2008 Internet revenue estimates; this may reflect an oncoming recession, may be specific to Microsoft, or may represent a form of posturing in the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The possible scenarios from here&lt;/strong&gt;, in roughly decreasing order of probability, include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hostile Takeover&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft moves forward with a full-fledged hostile takeover -- trying to replace Yahoo's board and/or taking its offer directly to Yahoo's shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Offer&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft raises its offer or otherwise modifies its offer terms to make them more attractive -- for example, Microsoft could shift to an all-cash offer -- in an attempt to make the deal happen without going fully hostile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk Away&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft drops its offer and walks away; Yahoo's stock drops to its pre-offer level of $19.18, give or take.  Lots of moves and countermoves could follow: Microsoft could come back later with a lower or higher offer; Yahoo could cut a Google advertising deal to boost its revenue and margins and make itself harder to buy; Microsoft could take its $44 billion and go buy virtually every new Internet company of any consequence founded in the last 10 years; etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yahoo Caves&lt;/strong&gt;: Yahoo's board caves and accepts the current Microsoft offer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Knight&lt;/strong&gt;: Another bidder enters and offers Yahoo a higher price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's assume the Hostile Takeover scenario&lt;/strong&gt;, which seems to me to be the most likely given Microsoft's strategy and explicit public statements.  What happens then?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There are two primary hostile takeover tactics:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;tender offer&lt;/strong&gt;, which we can equivalently call an &lt;strong&gt;exchange offer&lt;/strong&gt; since the offer includes Microsoft stock that would be exchanged for Yahoo stock.  This would be an offer by Microsoft to acquire Yahoo shares from existing Yahoo shareholders directly.  Note that this hasn't happened yet; Microsoft's offer up until now has been made to Yahoo the company -- in a tender offer, the offer would be made directly to Yahoo's shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;proxy fight&lt;/strong&gt; by Microsoft to take control of Yahoo's board of directors -- to put in place a new Yahoo board that would accept Microsoft's current offer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;These two tactics could be used alone or in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the case of a tender offer&lt;/strong&gt;: if shareholders owning more than 50% of Yahoo's shares agree to the offer, Microsoft gains control of Yahoo directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, Microsoft probably wouldn't need to own a full 50% of Yahoo's shares -- it could own, say, 40% and then have effective control, because only one-sixth of Yahoo's remaining shareholders would have to vote with Microsoft on any issue in order for Microsoft to exercise control.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's best defense against a tender offer is its &lt;strong&gt;poison pill&lt;/strong&gt;.  The poison pill works like this: if Microsoft acquires more than 15% of Yahoo without Yahoo board approval, the poison pill kicks in and issues a flood of new Yahoo stock into the market in such a way that Yahoo becomes much more difficult and expensive to buy.  Poison pills have been used as defensive mechanisms by public companies against hostile takeovers for years, and the dilution they cause is so huge that no poison pill of this type has ever been triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than trigger the poison pill, Microsoft would most likely condition its tender offer on Yahoo's board cancelling its poison pill.  If the Yahoo board refused to cancel the poison pill, Microsoft could sue in a Delaware court to force a cancellation of the pill.  (Any and all litigation to force Yahoo to come to terms will be in Delaware, since that is where Yahoo is incorporated.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware courts give some deference to target boards in resisting hostile takeovers, especially in the early stages of a takeover fight, but in many cases the courts have been unwilling to allow targets to "just say no" in the face of a well-financed offer at a significant premium -- which is the situation Yahoo is facing.  It's impossible to predict what a court will do, but Delaware courts are more likely to force a poison pill to be cancelled when a target board has had plenty of time to drum up alternatives to the hostile offer, and where the hostile offer is well-financed and represents a significant premium to the company.  This gets even more likely if the bidder has raised its price during the process, which hasn't happened here -- yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the case of a proxy fight&lt;/strong&gt;, which Microsoft has overtly threatened: Microsoft would nominate an alternate slate of directors for election to the Yahoo board in place of the current directors.  If Yahoo shareholders favor the Microsoft bid, they can vote for Microsoft's alternate directors, who -- if elected to Yahoo's board -- would approve the Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;A proxy fight may have special appeal for Microsoft for a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;, it could work in one fell swoop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Many public companies have a "staggered" board, where some directors are up for election or reelection each year, but the entire board is never up for reelection in a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, however, has its entire board standing for reelection each year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this was not a good idea -- whoever set this up at Yahoo made a serious mistake.  In a proxy fight with a staggered board, target management can lose a proxy fight and still control two-thirds of the board.  In Yahoo's case, if Microsoft wins one proxy fight, it takes out the entire Yahoo board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;It would be practically impossible for Yahoo to change to a staggered board now -- in fact, trying to do so would immediately give Microsoft its opportunity to nominate its slate of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;, Yahoo can't block a proxy fight via a poison pill or any other mechanism.  They can delay it -- a bit -- but they cannot block it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gets control of Yahoo if it puts up a slate of directors for election and they win at Yahoo's 2008 annual meeting.  All that is needed for Microsoft's slate to win is to get more votes at the meeting than Yahoo's incumbent directors.  Since not all Yahoo shareholders will bother to vote, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft doesn't need a majority of all shares to win -- it just needs more votes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Microsoft has leaked to the press the fact that it has already assembled a slate of directors who have agreed to run against Yahoo's board in the event Microsoft moves forward with a proxy fight.  The Microsoft slate includes several former CEO's, COO's, and CFO's -- individuals certainly qualified to sit on a corporate board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Microsoft wins the proxy fight, then its acquisition of Yahoo is probably a foregone conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;  Microsoft's slate of directors would be expected to vote to cancel the Yahoo poison pill, allowing Microsoft to make its tender offer for Yahoo's shares.  However, the new Microsoft-installed board would still have to exercise its fiduciary duties and carefully assess whether the Microsoft offer is in the best interests of Yahoo shareholders -- if the new board acted rashly to rubber-stamp the Microsoft takeover, it could theoretically be sued by pro-Yahoo shareholders, although that lawsuit would be an uphill battle.  Further, Yahoo's poison pill would throw some procedural hurdles Microsoft's way: the pill says that for a 180-day period following a successful hostile proxy fight, the new board can only cancel the pill if it follows certain procedures, including getting an independent financial advisor to opine that cancelling the pill is in the shareholder's best interests.  All this would do is slow down Microsoft's takeover -- it would still happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shareholder vote on the Microsoft board slate would happen at Yahoo's 2008 annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has bought time by amending its bylaws to delay the deadline for making board nominations for this year's board election, and could buy additional time by delaying the date of its 2008 annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Yahoo board nominations had to be made by March 14.  While searching for an alternate bidder, Yahoo did not want to face a proxy fight starting in March, so it amended its bylaws to require board nominations to be made within a 10 day window after Yahoo announces the date for its 2008 annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has not yet announced the date for its 2008 annual meeting.  &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, under Delaware law, Yahoo has to have its annual meeting by July 12 -- the 13-month anniversary of its last annual meeting -- or Microsoft can sue to force a prompt annual meeting.  Microsoft would almost certainly win that lawsuit, and the court would probably force a meeting within 60 to 90 days.  So Yahoo can at least delay its annual meeting and therefore the board election process until July, and perhaps as late as October if it is willing to force Microsoft to sue to schedule a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;So this may yet come to remind you of the Democratic presidential primary season -- it may last a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other interesting questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is Yahoo's board legally required to think about the Microsoft offer?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware law requires a board to act in the best interests of the company's shareholders.  Yahoo's board is not required to take Microsoft's offer, but a fully-financed offer at a 62% premium -- as this offer is -- puts a tremendous amount of pressure on Yahoo's board to take the offer, even if Microsoft doesn't increase the price.  I.e. the Yahoo board is not refusing the current offer lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If the Yahoo board continues to refuse Microsoft's offer without a better offer in hand, it could be dealing with shareholder lawsuits for years to come.  These would be lawsuits where lawyers who specialize in such claims accuse the board of breaching its fiduciary duties and costing shareholders money as a result.  Odds are Yahoo's directors would not be personally at risk, since Yahoo has various indemnity and insurance arrangements in place that protect directors from personal liability.  But still, those lawsuits would be no fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What happens if another acquiror -- say News Corp. -- enters the bidding with a higher price?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose another bidder, like News Corp., enters the fray and offers $32/share, versus the current $29.68 Microsoft bid.  Yahoo's board would of course be free to take the higher bid from News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, suppose Microsoft then raises &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; bid to $33/share, and then News Corp. holds its bid at $32/share.  Could Yahoo's board still take News Corp.'s bid in preference to Microsoft's?  In a word: no.  When a board is presented with multiple offers, it can either take the highest objective offer or it can turn down all the offers.  It cannot take an offer lower than the highest objective offer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat to this: a target board is allowed some leeway in interpreting an offer that consists of the bidder's stock, in whole or in part.  So judging objective value can get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But the upshot is, even if Yahoo gins up another bidder, it still cannot &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; an alternate bid if Microsoft's offering price is objectively the highest of the available offers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who are the Yahoo shareholders and how are they thinking about this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's shareholder ownership profile is the key to the ultimate outcome of all of this.  If a majority of the shareholders want Yahoo to stay independent, it very well might be able to -- or, if not, not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Insiders, including cofounders Jerry Yang and David Filo, own just over 10% of Yahoo's stock -- not enough to block Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional shareholders -- large professional money managers -- own about 72.4% of Yahoo's stock.  These institutions, broadly speaking, fall into two categories: normal investors, and arbitrageurs.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Normal investors may want to back Yahoo management, but yet may still be forced to vote in favor of the Microsoft deal since they may be unwilling or unable to stomach the likely fall in Yahoo's stock price if the deal doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitrageurs, on the other hand, are only in the stock to make money on the spread between Yahoo's current stock price and the ultimate offering price of a consummated deal.  These are the people who bought Yahoo stock on the day Microsoft's offer was announced, when Yahoo's stock jumped nearly $10 in a single trading session.  They will always support a transaction, by definition -- the last thing they want is to be long-term holders of anyone's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear what percentage of Yahoo's institutional ownership consists of arbitrageurs vs normal investors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, individual shareholders own the remaining approximately 17% of Yahoo's shares.  What they do is always anybody's guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, there is a group of about seven or eight large institutional shareholders who will ultimately decide Yahoo's fate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would a dual-class share structure have been a good idea for Yahoo?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;A dual-class share structure is when a company's founding managers or investors own a different kind of stock that gives them voting control of the company even when they don't own a majority of the total shares.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-class share structures have been common for decades in the media industry -- they are the reason the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is still controlled by the Sulzberger family, even as the value of its business plummets towards zero.  But they have not been common in the technology industry, where they have been viewed as hostile to normal investors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think Google has changed all that -- Google has a dual-class share structure that gives Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt de facto total control over the company, and investors certainly haven't avoided Google's stock as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo does not have a dual-class share structure, and it's too late to put one into place now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If Yahoo did have a dual-class share structure, Yahoo's cofounders would have been much better situated to block Microsoft from attempting a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;You can bet that this is being noticed by the founders of every technology company that might go public from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are we learning about hostile takeovers in the technology industry?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We are learning that hostile takeovers have arrived in our industry.  This is the second major hostile takeover so far -- the other was Oracle's takeover of Peoplesoft -- but there will be more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This is significant because historically hostile takeovers practically never happened in technology.  Potential hostile acquirors assumed that hostile takeovers wouldn't work because the target company's employees would bail and the target company's business would collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that as technology companies become larger and more mature, acquirors are becoming increasingly convinced that neither of these assumptions hold.  Perhaps employees of large tech companies aren't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bonded to current management, and perhaps many of them would actually prefer to work for a larger, more dominant combined company.  And maybe as a consequence, the target's business would do just fine in the wake of a hostile takeover -- in fact, maybe it would do better, due to advantages of combined size and scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;My bet is that hostile takeovers, particularly of larger and more mature companies, are going to become increasingly common in our industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement may be just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently filed an SEC-mandated Form D for a new &lt;a href="http://ning.com/"&gt;Ning&lt;/a&gt; investment round that we were not otherwise going to talk about -- but &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/"&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; discovered the filing and so the news is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specifics are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have raised about $60 million net in a private Series D equity round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pre-money valuation was $500 million, making the post-money valuation about $560 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our friends at Allen &amp; Company helped us orchestrate the round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new investors are large institutions who are not particularly looking for publicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;We raised the money to enable us to keep scaling given our accelerating growth (over 230,000 networks on Ning now, growing at over 1,000 per day) and to make sure we have plenty of firepower to survive the oncoming nuclear winter.  At current growth rates, we don't need it to get to cash flow positive, but having lived through the last crunch, it's good to be conservative with these things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eec2cf76-0678-11dd-802c-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules regarding how banks account for off-balance sheet interests are “irretrievably broken”, a senior group of international rulemakers has warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules, which have allowed trillions [note the "t" -- not "m" or "b" but "t"] in assets to escape close scrutiny, have come under attack in the wake of the credit crisis as banks have been forced to disclose huge losses on these holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a report by a high-level group of accountants has warned that completion of the current overhaul of the rules would not be possible in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Completing a final standard by mid-2011 will be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible,” says the report seen by the Financial Times and prepared by board members of the US-based Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the report does not yet represent the official view of the accounting bodies, it is a sign of the turmoil within the industry in grappling with the off-balance sheet issue. [By "grappling", they mean, "Holy s---, are we in trouble now."]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounting standard setters are already under pressure for their support of marking assets to current market prices – a practice that has resulted in billions in writedowns and affected banks’ profitability seriously. [That's not the issue with mark-to-market -- the issue with mark-to-market is that it leads to a death spiral by which new downward marks lead to loan calls and fund redemptions which lead to panic selling which leads to new downward marks which leads to... you guessed it, banks' off-balance-sheet entities going kablooey and suddenly showing up at the door like your unwanted uncle.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability [ha!] Forum, a global body of regulators and central bankers, has asked the IASB and its US counterpart to consider the issue as a matter of urgency. Accounting standard setters are in the throes of discussing how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the report by the high-level group of accountants says the project to overhaul current rules on off-balance sheet interests has lost momentum because of staff turnover and “relative inexperience”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Enron?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine Enron times a hundred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just gives me an excuse, after hyperventilating, to roll out one of my favorite &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; cartoons...&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">
&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next several months, I will walk through many of the interesting aspects of the creation of several of today's major forms of media -- including newspapers, magazines, television, movies, and books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motivation is threefold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, the &lt;strong&gt;true history&lt;/strong&gt; of these forms of media is inevitably more fascinating, more amazing, and often more humorous than you would think.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of a newspaper, or a movie, or a television show, was not handed down on stone tablets from Mount Olympus and simply carried forward by people who said, "Oh yeah, great idea!"; rather, the forms of media we see today are in all cases the result of a mad and chaotic frenzy of experimentation, uncertainty, and enterpreneurial effort.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second, understanding the drama, flux, and change that invariably accompanied the creation of traditional media will help put our &lt;strong&gt;current Internet revolution into perspective&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All early forms of media had lots of people who suffered from doubt, were skeptical, were dismissive, or just didn't get it -- and in fact there were a lot of dead ends and failures from a lot of innovators before the true form of any medium and its business foundation became clear.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of that doubt, skepticism, criticism, and failure were in each case accompanied by enormous social, cultural, political, and business transformations when things did finally become clear.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Third, understanding the flux and drama of the creation of traditional media, I believe, highlights the nature of the &lt;strong&gt;profound challenges&lt;/strong&gt; facing today's managers of traditional media companies.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of smart people are working very hard to transition traditional forms of media into the new Internet world order, but I also think their challenges are even more serious and dangerous than most people believe, and that today's media companies' primary strategy of defense is very challenging when the world shifts hard on its axis, as it has done in the past and as it is doing now.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with &lt;strong&gt;newspapers&lt;/strong&gt;.  My source for this and several subsequent posts is Eric Burns' outstanding book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MV8HMA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=marandsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000MV8HMA"&gt;Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on the role of newspapers during the American Revolution, but also covers the creation of the newspaper medium up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's first [newspaper] seems to have been the work of a "Renaissance blackmailer and pornographer"...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we're off with a bang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...the Italian Pietro Aretino, who set up shop [in the early 1500's] a few years after the invention of movable type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aretino could have done something constructive with his little publication.  He could have written about Florence under the Medicis becoming the center of art and humanism in the Western world.  He could have written about the founding of the University of Palermo, which would soon be a major institution for the advancement of learning...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aretino did none of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, he "produced a regular series of [anti-religious] obscenities, libelous stories, public accusations, and personal opinion".  The opinion was boldly, and often vulgarly, expressed.  It was also for sale, with Aretino running a kind of protection racket on those who were the subjects of his stories: pay what he asked and he praised you; refuse and you were slathered with abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No comment from me on whether that practice continues in certain circles today.  Nope, no comment...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, you were a commodity for him; he would tell the tale that suited him best and profit from you as much as he could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still no comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But few people in Renaissance Italy read Aretino's rag, and it did not stay in business long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people read the British broadsides [single-sided newspapers] of the early 17th century [either]; they, too, were ephemeral in duration and impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not that Europeans disliked these nascent attempts at journalism; more fundamentally, they did not understand the reason for them, living as they did in a world in which news could not thrive as a commodity because it barely existed as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could it?  The Almighty was what mattered to men and women in ages past, but they could speak to Him directly.  Their families were what mattered to them, but husbands and wives and sons and daughters lived in the same room.  Their livelihood was what mattered to them, but they tended their shops or worked their fields from dawn until sunset...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...What mattered to a person in the 16th and early 17th centuries was what happened to him and to those closest to him between one sunrise and the next... but he could see that for himself.  He could interpret it for himself.  No intermediary was required to give voice or meaning to the events in his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the events that were not in his life, those that occurred in the lives of other people in other places, of what possible interest could they be to him?  The idea that a human being could be instructed or amused by the fortunes of a stranger was as foreign to a European back then as a land across the sea.  The world outside one's immediate ken was a place of mystery, not a source of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right there we get a foreshadowing of what was about to happen... the rise of newspapers, among the other early communication and information networks such as postal systems, was driven by &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; drove major transformations in the basic concepts of society and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't let anyone ever tell you that what we do, and what our industry does, lacks significance -- without new forms of information distribution and communication, we'd all still be living as subsistence farmers in a feudal hell on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm getting ahead of myself...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally there was something from afar that a person needed to know.  There might be an edict from the king ordering his subjects to provide an even greater share of their harvest to the royal granaries... [or tax increases or religious declarations].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this kind of thing did not happen often, and was so unwelcome when it did that it did not inspire an interest in the wider world.  On the contrary: better ignorance than tidings that brought even more hardship to an individual than was already his lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of like a lot of recent election results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if the news &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been relevant to men and women of an earlier age, they would not have had time for it -- which was, of course, a further reason for their indifference.  They led... lives of toil and repetition.  They fed and milked and slaughtered their animals.  They cleared and plowed their fields and dammed their streams... They prayed to a strict and sometimes capricious God, wanting to please, and He was ever watching, ever judging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is all to say that they led the kinds of lives even a greed-besotted, hedge fund-managing workaholic of the early 21st century would have found punishing, every minute of every hour accounted for, every second of every minute.  And journalism... is to some extent a function of leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much of it existed when Aretino first inked up his press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then shifting to colonial America, it gets even worse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For [anyone] who thought about publishing a newspaper in colonial times... or the man of means who thought about financing the [publisher], there was a further disincentive to journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, there were not enough customers -- too few English speakers in America, too few towns and villages that were too widely scattered to allow for news to be gathered efficiently and a paper to be distributed economically.  In addition, as... Sidney Kobre points out, "trade, commerce, and industry were undeveloped.  Settlers for a long time made their own clothes and furniture and raised their own foodstuffs.  Advertising would not have been profitable, especially since money was scarce and the general income level low."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer Internet in 1995!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then there was the distribution problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 1639, Massachusetts had attempted the delivery of mail [obviously the only way to distribute newspapers at that point and for a long time to come] on a regular basis.  It was &lt;em&gt;ir&lt;/em&gt;regular at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem was roads, which either did not exist or were so rocky, rutted, and circuitous that they were as much obstacle courses as lanes of conveyance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28 kilobit modems in 1995!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or Comcast today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mail was often delayed, sometimes lost, and sometimes delivered to the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In the early days," Kobre writes, "if one wanted to get a letter to a relative or friend in another colony, he waited for a ship captain or a traveler passing through, perhaps a merchant sending a package or a cargo of goods.  Sometimes, if it were urgent, one employed a friendly [Native American] to deliver a letter for him."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 1673, the Boston Port Road opened for the specific purpose of transporting letters, parcels, commercial goods, and newspapers from Boston to New York, a distance of 250 miles.  A horse could travel it without breaking an ankle... The mail did not always arrive within two weeks, as promised, but it almost always got there eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;56 kilobit modems in 1996!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's the issue of production:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could, of course, be no news... without presses on which to print it, and the first such machine did not appear in the New World until 1638 [at Harvard]... but by 1685, almost half a century later, the grand total of printing presses in the New World had risen to a mere &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt;, and they were essentially what they had been in Gutenberg's time, which is to say cumbersome apparatuses that were as likely to break down as to grind out a story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, they turned out Bibles...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But five years later, and more than eight decades after the first British expatriates had set foot in Jamestown, one of those presses would begin printing the first American newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just in this first post in the series, we get a sense of the profound wonder that the newspaper was even brought into existence, much less became widespread or had an impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we see the nature of the birthing pains of a new medium -- any new medium -- and obviously, all of the birthing pains of the modern consumer Internet are trivial in comparison to the mind-boggling headwinds the original newspaper entrepreneurs faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I'll focus on the creation of newspapers in America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had missed this essential and hilarious fact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Three days before Bear Stearns went kablooey, and the same day he hollered about how "fine" Bear Stearns was on his quasi-TV show], on TheStreet.com, Jim Cramer listed Bear Stearns common stock as a "buy" at $62...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[After Bear blew up] TheStreet.com quickly removed Cramer's March 11 "buy" recommendation from its page devoted to Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Cramer: no matter how bad you think he is, he's worse than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future blogger &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/world/americas/28cybersyn.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=americas&amp;pagewanted=print"&gt;Alexei Barrionuevo&lt;/a&gt; writing in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When military forces loyal to Gen. Augusto Pinochet staged a coup [in Santiago, Chile] in September 1973, they made a surprising discovery. Salvador Allende’s Socialist government had quietly embarked on a novel experiment to manage Chile’s economy using a clunky mainframe computer and a network of telex machines. [Who you callin' clunky?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project, called Cybersyn, was the brainchild of A. Stafford Beer, a visionary Briton who employed his “cybernetic” concepts to help Mr. Allende find an alternative to the planned economies of Cuba and the Soviet Union. After the coup it became the subject of intense military scrutiny. [Yes, I imagine it did.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developing Cybersyn, Mr. Beer changed the lives of the bright young Chileans he worked with here. Some 35 years later, this little-known feature of Mr. Allende’s abortive Socialist transformation was remembered in an exhibit in a museum beneath La Moneda, the presidential palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Star Trek-like chair with controls in the armrests [they ain't kidding -- check out the &lt;a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/03/28/world/americas/28cybersyn.450.jpg"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt;] was a replica of those in a prototype operations room. Mr. Beer planned for the room to receive computer reports based on data flowing from telex machines connected to factories up and down this 2,700-mile-long country. Managers were to sit in seven of the contoured chairs and make critical decisions about the reports displayed on projection screens. [Brilliant!  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28TV_series%29#Counter_Terrorist_Unit"&gt;CTU&lt;/a&gt; for the economy!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...Cybersyn was born in July 1971 [the month and year your faithful blogger was born... this is blowing my mind...] when Fernando Flores, then a 28-year-old government technocrat, sent a letter to Mr. Beer seeking his help in organizing Mr. Allende’s economy by applying cybernetic concepts. Mr. Beer was excited by the prospect of being able to test his ideas. [Boy, I'll bet he was -- can you imagine?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wanted to use the telex communications system — a network of teletypewriters — to gather data from factories on variables like daily output, energy use and labor “in real time,” and then use a computer to filter out the important pieces of economic information the government needed to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Beer set up teams of computer programmers in England and Chile, and began making regular trips to Santiago to direct the project...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do have to give them credit for one thing -- it would have been a better plan than the standard "make s*** up" strategy pursued by so many &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/12/05/real_estate/Clinton_foreclosure_prevention/?postversion=2007120516"&gt;other politicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dude deserves to go in the history books alongside Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tell me you've never wanted to sit in a chair like that...&lt;/p&gt;

&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper industry has experienced the worst drop in advertising revenue in more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;According to new data released by the Newspaper Association of America, total print advertising revenue in 2007 plunged 9.4% to $42 billion compared to 2006 -- the most severe percent decline since the association started measuring advertising expenditures in 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The drop-off points to an economic slowdown on top of the secular challenges faced by the industry. The second worst decline in advertising revenue occurred in 2001 when it fell 9.0%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Total advertising revenue in 2007 -- including online revenue -- decreased 7.9% to $45.3 billion compared to the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There are signs that online revenue is beginning to slow as well. Internet ad revenue in 2007 grew 18.8% to $3.2 billion compared to 2006. In 2006, online ad revenue had soared 31.4% to $2.6 billion. In 2005, it jumped 31.4% to $2 billion...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The NAA reported that online revenue now represents [a completely inadequate] 7.5% of total newspaper ad revenue in 2007 compared to 5.7% in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;That growth could not stave off the losses in the print however. National print advertising revenue dropped 6.7% to $7 billion last year. Retail slipped 5% to $21 billion. Classified plunged 16.5% to $14.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed former Bear Stearns &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119387369474078336.html?mod=hps_us_whats_news"&gt;absentee&lt;/a&gt; CEO Jimmy Cayne is in the news today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James "Jimmy" Cayne, chairman [and, until January, CEO] of Bear Stearns, sold his shares in the crippled securities firm for $61.3 million...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cayne sold 5.66 million shares at $10.84 apiece on March 25 [two days ago], according to a regulatory filing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of his stake plummeted from almost $1 billion last year, when the shares peaked at $171.50 before the collapse of the subprime mortgage market toppled two of the firm's hedge funds and prompted a contraction in credit markets worldwide [and the effective bankruptcy of Bear Stearns, rescued from real bankruptcy at the last possible moment only by a $30 billion loan from the US taxpayer via the Federal Reserve].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Source: &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601010&amp;sid=aPkUaAmBR5ZM&amp;refer=news"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to translate from the Wall Street:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US taxpayer is loaning Bear Stearns and JP Morgan Chase, Bear Stearns' acquirer, $29 billion -- just revised from $30 billion, simultaneous with JP Morgan Chase raising its acquisition price for Bear Stearns to $10/share from $2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without that $29 billion of taxpayer money, Jimmy Cayne's stock would be worth $0/share, and if you multiply that by 5.66 million shares, the total would be $0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $29 billion taxpayer loan is almost certain to lose money as it is being used to backstop stinky assets on the Bear Stearns balance sheet -- the same assets whose plummeting fall in value catalyzed Bear Stearns' effective bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is virtually certain that taxpayers are going to take some loss on that $29 billion loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When we do&lt;/em&gt;, we will have the immense satisfaction of knowing that the first $61.3 million of those losses represent a direct cash transfer from US taxpayers to Jimmy Cayne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there's any more color out there on this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past weeks, together with his wife... who is a student of Jewish religious traditions, Mr. Cayne has spent considerable time searching for comparable events in religious history to see what lessons can be learned from the collapse of his firm, said a person who has spoken to him recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, that episode where the money changers in the temple leveraged their business up 40-to-1 and then went bankrupt, but got bailed out by a loan from the Roman citizenry of 29 billion pieces of silver, comes immediately to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Source: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/business/28bear.html?ref=business"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who is a significant expert on US securities law told me something interesting a couple years ago, after Sarbanes-Oxley passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, you know, Marc, the laws on public company governance and controls -- particularly the responsibilities of the CEO -- are now &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; intense and &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; tight that I bet if you had subpoena power for any public company in the country, you could prove some form of criminal violation by the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how honest and upright the individual -- the laws are so strict and there are so many details that have to be correct, almost any CEO could be found guilty of and sent to jail for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest Jimmy Cayne as an excellent test case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Defense Secretary Robert Gates has formally ordered the Air Force, Navy and Defense Logistics Agency to conduct an inventory of all U.S. nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon-related materials to make sure all items are accounted for...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The order comes in the wake of the discovery last week that four nuclear warhead fuses were accidentally shipped to Taiwan in 2006...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The inventory review, which will involve thousands of items, is due to Gates in 60 days. Pentagon officials said the request was ordered, in part, because this latest incident comes after the August 2007 accidental flight of six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on a B-52 bomber across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The CNN headline is to the point and priceless:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Pentagon Ordered To Locate All U.S. Nukes&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to think of an idea that would be even better than this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And I have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This is, officially, the best good idea of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are moving ahead with a case against one of two 93-year-old men picked up during undercover prostitution stings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Frank Milio, prosecutors have issued subpoenas and plan to take him to trial in April.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Milio, according to police records, tried to pay $20 in November to an undercover officer on 14th Street West.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Milio recently told the Herald-Tribune he was only flirting with the woman.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"I haven't had that in years," he said. "Ninety-three is kind of old."&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos Underhill, 93, will not be charged, although he does not deny stopping to chat with the "good-looking girl" who made eyes at him and turned out to be an undercover officer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Police say Underhill was willing to pay $30 for sex and that he promised to come back a few hours later to consummate the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say that they cannot move ahead with the criminal case because there is no way to prove Underhill planned to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Underhill was fined $150 for trying to pick up a prostitute in 1990, when he was 75. In the latest case, he says, he was not cruising Tamiami Trail for sex: He just wanted to chat with the buxom woman who smiled at him as he drove past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"All I was going to do was talk," he said Monday. "It wasn't for sex. I am 93, you know."&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Now, granted, the only woman I'm going to be flirting with when I'm 93 is my lovely wife.  Nevertheless: my new heroes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I showed you a widely-distributed &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/03/stocks-is-hard.html"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of CNBC stunt-host Jim Cramer loudly gesticulating to his &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;/em&gt; fan base that Bear Stearns was "fine" and that "Bear Stearns is not in trouble".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was March 11, Bear stock was trading at $62, and Bear immediately blew up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several members of the Cramer fan base promptly emailed me and said, no no no, Cramer explained that he was just saying that you shouldn't move your money out of your Bear Stearns brokerage account.  Which is a little odd, given that Bear was primarily a hedge fund prime broker and not a consumer broker, and Cramer's show is aimed at regular folks, a.k.a. consumers.  However, it is possible that his defenders could have a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except they don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the very same day, March 11, Cramer also recorded a different &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1078966384/bclid1111461880/bctid1452603213"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; (not embeddable, so just follow that link) on TheStreet.com in which he explains in detail how Bear &lt;em&gt;the company&lt;/em&gt; is "totally solvent; there's not an issue; Bear is not in trouble, I want to make that point vociferously".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will give Cramer's fans credit for one thing -- he is highly entertaining.  Although frankly I'm still not sure how he's ever going to top &lt;a href="http://legalpad.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2007/04/09/on-jim-cramer-stock-manipulation-and-press-manipulation/"&gt;confessing publicly to securities violations&lt;/a&gt; last year.  One can but hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I being mean to Cramer?  Two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, his whole approach is fundamentally fraudulent.  You can't sit at home, watch a TV show, actively trade stocks like Cramer says, and make money.  At best you're going to badly lag the indices, and in the process unduly enrich your brokerage firm, the tax collectors, and -- yes -- CNBC and Jim Cramer.  Cramer's show is just another stupid tax, like a state lottery, or cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1078966384/bclid1137812485/bctid1469604315"&gt;he says he likes it&lt;/a&gt; (fast-forward to about 3:15 and watch to the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I may not be able to embed TheStreet.com videos, but I sure can embed Jon Stewart's take on Cramer's Bear Stearns call -- just fast-forward to 4:40 or so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger"&gt;Charlie Munger&lt;/a&gt; is an 80-something billionaire who cofounded top-tier law firm &lt;a href="http://www.mto.com/home_main.cfm"&gt;Munger, Tolles &amp;amp; Olson&lt;/a&gt; and is Warren Buffett's long-time partner and Vice-Chairman at &lt;a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/"&gt;Berkshire Hathaway&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most successful companies of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people, including me, consider Mr. Munger to be an even more interesting thinker and writer than Mr. Buffett, and recently a group of Mr. Munger's friends assembled a compilation book of his most interesting thoughts and speeches called &lt;a href="http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/index.html"&gt;Poor Charlie's Almanack&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by Ben Franklin's &lt;em&gt;Poor Richard's Almanack&lt;/em&gt;.  (The Munger book is only available on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157864366X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=marandsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=157864366X"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in used form, although you can apparently buy a new copy &lt;a href="https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/orderform_v2.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Munger's magnum opus speech, included in the book, is &lt;em&gt;The Psychology of Human Misjudgment&lt;/em&gt; -- an exposition of 25 key forms of human behavior that lead to misjudgment and error, derived from Mr. Munger's 60 years of business experience.  Think of it as a practitioner's summary of human psychology and behavioral economics as observed in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog posts, I will walk through all 25 of the biases Mr. Munger identifies, and then adapt them for the modern entrepreneur.  In each case I will start with relevant excerpts of Mr. Munger's speech, and then after that add my own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One: Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I place this tendency first in my discussion because almost everyone thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives and disincentives are in changing cognition and behavior. But this is not often so. For instance, I think I've been in the top five percent of my age cohort almost all my adult life in understanding the power of incentives, and yet I've always underestimated that power. Never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my appreciation of incentive superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...We [should] heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of Ben Franklin in &lt;em&gt;Poor Richard's Almanack&lt;/em&gt;: "If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason." This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important consequences of incentive superpower is what I call "incentive caused bias." A man has an acculturated nature making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both consciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drifts into immoral behavior in order to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior [like a salesman who harms her customers by selling them the wrong product because she gets paid more for selling it, versus the right product -- see, e.g., the mutual fund industry].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...Another generalized consequence of incentive caused bias is that man tends to "game" all human systems, often displaying great ingenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others. Antigaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary part of almost all system design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...Military and naval organizations have very often been extreme in using punishment [the inverse of reward] to change behavior, probably because they needed to cause extreme behavior. Around the time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the assembly horn blew, always killed the last warrior to reach his assigned place, and no one enjoyed fighting this tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human response to incentives is indeed a huge behavioral motivator, and I think Mr. Munger is right that once you think you realize how big it is, you need to assume it's even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why stock options work so well in startups -- and the fewer people in a startup, the better stock options work, since when there are only a few people in a company, it's usually crystal clear to each person how her work will impact the value of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://webreprints.djreprints.com/882011413375.html"&gt;wrong-headed and dangerous theory afoot&lt;/a&gt; that restricted stock (grants of fully in-the-money shares of stock) is a more appropriate motivator of employees of tech companies than stock options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gates wanted Mr. Buffett's input on whether to drop options in favor of restricted stock at Microsoft. [Gates] recalls asking: "How will employees respond to getting a lottery ticket that gives them a definite amount instead of one that could amount to nothing or a ridiculous sum?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Buffett's reply, according to Mr. Gates, was: "My wife would rather have a ticket for one fur coat, than a ticket that gave her two or nothing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overt sexism aside, from an incentive standpoint the result of shifting from stock options to restricted stock should be obvious: current employees will be incented to &lt;em&gt;preserve&lt;/em&gt; value instead of &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; value.  And new hires will by definition be people who are conservative and change-averse, as the people who want to swing for the fences and get rewarded for creating something new will go somewhere else, where they will receive stock options -- in typically greater volume than anyone will ever grant restricted stock -- and have greater upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, in the wake of shifting towards restricted stock and away from stock options, Microsoft's stock has been flat as a pancake.  The incentive works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, against that, it is true that stock options, particularly for public companies, have an often-destructive random component: they tend to increase in value in rising stock market environments and decrease in value (potentially to zero) in falling stock market environments, regardless of whether value is being created inside your particular company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, in the long run it probably makes sense for some new approach to stock-based compensation to be developed that both preserves the motivation to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to &lt;em&gt;preserve&lt;/em&gt; value, but factors out the environmental swings of rising and falling stock markets.  Some form of indexing against market averages would probably do the trick.  This has been tried from time to time, and I expect it to be tried more in the future, at least for public companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a company grows, stock options and other forms of equity-based motivation become less and less useful as an incentive tool, since it becomes harder for many employees in a large company to see how their individual behavior would have any effect on the stock price of the overall corporation.  So, more tactical incentives kick in, such as cash bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of tactical incentives -- e.g. bonuses -- is a whole topic in and of itself, and is critically important as your company grows.  The most significant thing to keep in mind is that how the goals are designed &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters -- as Mr. Munger says, people tend to game any system you put in place, and then they tend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was Andy Grove who said that &lt;em&gt;for every goal you put in front of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict gaming of the first goal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, if you are incenting your recruiters on the number of new employees recruited and hired, you need to also give them a counter-goal (and tie it to their compensation) that measures the quality of the new hires three months in.  Otherwise the recruiters are guaranteed to give you what you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want: a lot of mediocre new hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great unwritten Silicon Valley skewed incentive stories was a major datacenter vendor in the late 90's that incented its salespeople based on &lt;em&gt;bookings&lt;/em&gt; of long-term datacenter leases, without sufficient counter-goals tied to revenue collection or the customer's ability to pay.  Sure enough, soon the company's reported bookings were heading straight up, revenue was flat, and cash headed straight down, resulting in a truly spectacular bankruptcy.  The salespeople got paid, though, so they were happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, skewed incentives in the mortgage industry -- mortage issuers getting paid based on quantity of mortgages issued, versus ability to pay -- caused many of the current catastrophic Wall Street financial meltdowns you get to read about every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even engineers need counter-goals: incent engineers based purely on a ship date, and you'll get a shipping product with lots of bugs.  Incent based on number of bugs fixed, and you'll never get any new features.  And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially in smaller companies, peer pressure can be a very effective form of incentive.  This is greatly enabled and abetted by transparency.  People hate to be embarrassed in front of their peer group, so if it's crystal clear who's performing well and who isn't, poor performers will be highly motivated to improve -- and if they're not, that's good to know, since obviously then you really need to fire them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, any entrepreneur should be highly attuned to incentives when hiring outside executives, especially a CEO.  Hire a CEO and give her a large stock-option grant with four-year vesting, and you can guarantee she will sell the company in year four.  Give her a stock-option grant with accelerated vesting on change of control and she will sell the company sooner than that.  Founders can get tripped up on this because they naturally have an emotional incentive to see the company succeed that hired executives often do not share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about.html"&gt;never get caught between a venture capitalist and her incentives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two: Liking/Loving Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...[W]hat will a man naturally come to like and love, apart from his parent, spouse and child? Well, he will like and love being liked and loved... [M]an will generally strive, lifelong, for the affection and approval of many people not related to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very practical consequence of Liking/Loving Tendency is that it acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend (1) to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection, (2) to favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his affection (as we shall see when we get to "Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency"), and (3) to distort other facts to facilitate love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of this principle to entrepreneurs is obvious: entrepreneurs want to be liked just like everyone else, and wanting to be liked can be a major impediment to entrepreneurial success due to at least two major reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, an entrepreneur, like any CEO, has to make tough decisions about what her company will do, and those decisions will often run counter to the preferences of her employees.  You don't have to be involved in that many startups to find one where the entrepreneur knows she needs to make a tough decision -- such as change strategy, or cancel a flawed project -- but can't quite do it because employees won't like it.  Of course this always backfires: employees also don't like leaders who don't make the tough decisions that have to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, an entrepreneur, like any manager, has to fire people who aren't great or who aren't right for the tasks at hand.  This naturally makes people not like you, particularly the people you fire.  But again, not doing this backfires: nobody great wants to be in a company populated by mediocre or ill-fitting peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these pressures are intensified in a small company versus a larger company, because in a small company everyone tends to know everyone else and people naturally form strong personal relationships within the group -- so the desire to be liked is stronger, and the perceived risk from making decisions that people won't like is higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specific form of this dynamic in a startup is when you have multiple founders, of whom one is the CEO.  The founder who is the CEO inevitably discovers that it becomes very hard to stay close personal friends with the other founders.  As they say, it's lonely at the top -- if you're doing your job right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some entrepreneurs have emotional resistance to pursuing a strategy that does not meet with immediate approval from press, analysts, and other entrepreneurs.  This is worth watching carefully -- if everyone agrees right up front that whatever you are doing makes total sense, it probably isn't a new and radical enough idea to justify a new company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three: Disliking/Hating Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a pattern obverse to Liking/Loving Tendency, the newly arrived human is also "born to dislike and hate" as triggered by normal and abnormal triggering forces in its life...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the long history of man contains almost continuous war...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that makes the disliker/hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of dislike, (2) dislike people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his dislike, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is a problem &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; your company, then you have bigger issues than I can help you with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think this dynamic kicks in for a startup when thinking about competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see two destructive consequences of this bias in startups with competitors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I believe startups often &lt;em&gt;overfocus&lt;/em&gt; on their competitors.  It's the easiest thing in the world to orient yourself in opposition to another company in the same market, and to plan your actions based on what will cause damage to the competitor or block the competitor from getting business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the startup world, that often leads to multiple competitors engaged in a shooting war in a market that's still too small for anyone to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's much better for a startup to focus on creating and developing a large market, as opposed to fighting over a small market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when your startup's competitive juices get flowing -- especially for the first time -- and you find yourself fixated on a competitor, be sure to take a step back and say, is this really what we want to be focused on right now -- is the market we're both in really large enough to warrant this?  If so, sure, go for it, guns blazing.  But if not, stepping back and thinking about how to focus instead on creating a large market might be more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variant on this dynamic is letting your competitor determine your strategy by watching what he does and then making countermoves.  The issue here is that it's highly likely that neither one of you actually knows that much about what you are doing yet -- since you are in a new market, by definition -- and while you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you don't know that much about what you're doing yet, you only observe your competitors's deliberate actions as opposed to seeing their equivalent or greater level of internal confusion.  So they seem like they know what they're doing, and so you fall into assuming they know more than you do, when they probably don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in a truly competitive situation, this bias can easily lead you to underestimate your competitor by, as Mr. Munger says, "ignoring virtues in the object of dislike".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His product sucks, his salespeople aren't as good, his venture capitalists are those morons who backed that large datacenter vendor that went bankrupt -- and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, this attitude can become cultural in your company very quickly.  I think that if you're in a shooting war, even if you privately think your competitor is an amoral pinhead, that you establish a tone that says, we'll assume that he's highly competent and has many fine virtues, which we will respect and then systematically target with our own strengths and virtues until we have killed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four: Doubt-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the eons, drift toward such quick elimination of doubt. After all, the one thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So pronounced is the tendency in man to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision that behavior to counter the tendency is required from judges and jurors. Here, delay before decision making is forced. And one is required to so comport himself, prior to conclusion time, so that he is wearing a "mask" of objectivity. And the "mask" works to help real objectivity along, as we shall see when we next consider man's Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency? Well, an unthreatened man, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to remove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see later when we get to Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-Influence Tendency, what usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is some combination of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably a good one for entrepreneurs.  You'd better not have a lot of doubts about what you are doing because everyone else will, and if you do too, you'll probably give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, an entrepreneur's doubt avoidance is only a plus right up to the point where it becomes pigheaded stubbornness that interferes with her ability to see reality, particularly when a strategy is not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, entrepreneurial judgment is the ability to tell the difference between a situation that's not working but persistence and iteration will ultimately prove it out, versus a situation that's not working and additional effort is a destructive waste of time and radical change is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't believe there are any good rules for being able to tell the difference between the two.  Which is one of the main reasons starting a company is so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five: Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[People are] reluctant to change, which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. We see this in all human habits, constructive and destructive. Few people can list a lot of bad habits that they have eliminated, and some people cannot identify even one of these. Instead, practically every one has a great many bad habits he has long maintained despite their being known as bad. Given this situation, it is not too much in many cases to appraise early-formed habits as destiny. When Marley's miserable ghost says, "I wear the chains I forged in life," he is talking about chains of habit that were too light to be felt before they became too strong to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[T]ending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of the brain are one's previous conclusions, human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that a quickly reached conclusion, triggered by Doubt-Avoidance Tendency, when combined with a tendency to resist any change in that conclusion, will naturally cause a lot of errors in cognition for modern man. And so it observably works out. We all deal much with others whom we correctly diagnose as imprisoned in poor conclusions that are maintained by mental habits they formed early and will carry to their graves...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, people tend to accumulate large mental holdings of fixed conclusions and attitudes that are not often reexamined or changed, even though there is plenty of good evidence that they are wrong...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lord Keynes pointed out about his exalted intellectual group at one of the greatest universities in the world, it was not the intrinsic difficulty of new ideas that prevented their acceptance. Instead, the new ideas were not accepted because they were inconsistent with old ideas in place...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no less an authority for this than Max Planck, Nobel laureate, finder of "Planck's constant." Planck is famous not only for his science but also for saying that even in physics the radically new ideas are seldom really accepted by the old guard. Instead, said Planck, the progress is made by a new generation that comes along, less brain-blocked by its previous conclusions...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One corollary of Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency is that a person making big sacrifices in the course of assuming a new identity will intensify his devotion to the new identity. After all, it would be quite inconsistent behavior to make a large sacrifice for something that was no good. And thus civilization has invented many tough and solemn initiation ceremonies, often public in nature, that intensify new commitments made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes hand-in-hand with doubt-avoidance, and again is usually a plus for a startup, since it leads to greater commitment on the part of the entrepreneur and the team.  (And yes, I am in favor of blood oaths for startups.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this bias is most relevant to how new markets develop.  Sometimes you get lucky -- you bring a new product to market, and the target customers all go, great, we'll take it!  However, often you get a level of resistance from the market that can be puzzling -- "can't they see that our new product would be better for them than what they have now?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in turn leads to the odd dynamic you often see where a startup will field a new product, nobody wants it, and the startup goes belly up.  Then three or four or five years later, another startup launches with a very similar product, and this time the market says, hell yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is something that every entrepreneur needs to watch very carefully.  Sometimes it's simply a matter of timing -- and if people just aren't ready for a new idea, you usually can't make them ready, and you have to wait for them to change or for a new generation of customers to come along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite way around this problem is the one identified by Clayton Christensen in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1206408032&amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Innovator's Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;: don't go after existing customers in a category and try to get them to buy something new; instead, go find the new customers who weren't able to afford or adopt the incarnation of the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when the personal computer was invented, the desirable market was not the universe of people who were already buying computers -- a.k.a. mainframe and minicomputer buyers -- but rather the universe of the people who couldn't afford a mainframe or minicomputer and therefore had never had a computer before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the desirable market for Hotmail in the early days was not existing email aficionados who were already using sophisticated email desktop software, but rather the universe of people who were coming on the Internet for the first time who didn't even have email yet and for whom web-based email was by far the easiest way to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, one of the reasons that today's consumer Internet companies have the wind at our backs versus our peers 10 years ago is that a whole new generation of consumers has come of age in the last 10 years for whom the Internet is their primary medium -- time and demographics are on our side now.  That makes life a lot easier, let me tell you.  Meanwhile, the average age of television viewers continues drifting higher and higher...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six: Curiosity Tendency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, frankly, an odd one for Mr. Munger to include, since it's primarily a plus, and he doesn't really identify a downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only important thing I can think to add -- aside from the &lt;a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/how_to_hire_the.html"&gt;importance of hiring curious people&lt;/a&gt; -- is that lack of curiosity can be a huge danger to a startup in the following way: often, your initial strategy won't quite work, but you can learn as you go based on other things that happen in the market and eventually iterate into a strategy that does work.  Obviously, insufficient curiosity can prevent you from seeing the new data and lead you to continue to pursue a losing strategy even when you wouldn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be continued...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;Berkeley econ professor -- and non-conservative -- &lt;a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/03/morning-coffe-2.html"&gt;Brad DeLong&lt;/a&gt; on the highly controversial topic of how trade with lower-income countries like China affects, or does not affect, US wages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;...To what extent are rich countries obligated to open their markets to poor countries when the consequence is falling wages for the poor in the rich--bearing in mind that the poor in the rich are often wealthier and have more opporunity than the rich in the poor? To what extent do rich countries do themselves well--serve their national interest--by opening their markets to poor countries even when the consequence is falling wages for the poor in the rich?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;...First, between 1950 and 1997 trade and wages weren't an issue: our foreign trading partners raised their own relative wage levels at least as fast as globalization enhanced their influence, and there was no net effect of trade on wages--no link from greater openness to the global economy to greater inequality here at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Second, at times between 1950 and 1997 trade and wages became a political issue as a way of distracting attention from true problems. The voters of Michigan in 1985 did not want to hear that the problems of Michigan's manufacturing industries were home-grown--in the fecklessness of management and in the Reagan administration's budget deficits that pushed up interest rates which pushed up the value of the dollar and made the goods they made uncompetitive on world markets. They wanted, instead, to hear that the Japanese were doing something clever and illegitimate [&lt;em&gt;certainly a widespread assumption in Wisconsin when I was growing up in the 1980's -Marc&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Third: since 1997 or so the link between expanded imports and wage inequality has become real, as our imports now embody a much larger amount of factors competing with our own lesser-skilled than they used to. How large? I don't think we know. Paul Krugman [&lt;em&gt;also a non-conservative -Marc&lt;/em&gt;] is now writing a paper for the Brookings Institution in which he essentially throws up his hands at the question. But there are two points worth noting: (a) the effects of trade on pre-tax wage inequality are much smaller than the effects over the past generation of changes in the tax system on after-tax income inequality; (b) the effects of trade on inequality of opportunity are much less than the effects of educational inequities on inequality of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, to the extent that we in the United States begin thinking of trade restrictions as a way to fight inequality, we are setting ourselves up for extraordinary trouble late in this century--extraordinary damage to our long-run national security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: Consider a world that contains one country that is a true superpower. It is preeminent--economically, technologically, politically, culturally, and militarily. But it lies at the east edge of a vast ocean. And across the ocean is another country--a country with more resources in the long-run, a country that looks likely to in the end supplant the current superpower. What should the superpower's long-run national security strategy be?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is clear: if possible, the current superpower should embrace its possible successor. It should bind it as closely as possible with ties of blood, commerce, and culture--so that should the emerging superpower come to its full strength, it will to as great an extent possible share the world view of and regard itself as part of the same civilization as its predecessor: Romans to their Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In 1877, the rising superpower to the west across the ocean was the United States. The preeminent superpower was Britain. Today the preeminent superpower is the United States. The rising superpower to the west across the ocean is China. that was the rising superpower across the ocean to the west of the world's industrial and military leader. Today it is China.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the twentieth century it has been greatly to Britain's economic benefit that America has regarded it as a trading partner--a source of opportunities--rather than a politico-military-industrial competitor to be isolated and squashed. And in 1917 and again in 1941 it was to Britain's immeasurable benefit--its veruy soul was on the line--that America regarded it as a friend and an ally rather than as a competitor and an enemy. A world run by those whom de Gaulle called &lt;em&gt;les Anglo-Saxons&lt;/em&gt; is a much more comfortable world for Britain than the other possibility--the world in which Europe were run by Adolf Hitler's Saxon-Saxons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good chance that China is now on the same path to world preeminence that America walked 130 years ago. Come 2047 and again in 2071 and in the years after 2075, America is going to need China. There is nothing more dangerous for America's future national security, nothing more destructive to America's future prosperity, than for Chinese schoolchildren to be taught in 2047 and 2071 and in the years after 2075 that America tried to keep the Chinese as poor as possible for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;While I am far less certain than Brad and a lot of other smart people that the United States is fated to lose its position of economic preeminence in this century, I certainly agree with Brad's strategy, and I am continually surprised and alarmed to run into many well-meaning people who believe the opposite strategy would be optimal.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I'm delighted to announce that &lt;a href="http://ning.com"&gt;Ning&lt;/a&gt; just crossed 200,000 social networks for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you new to this blog, Ning is my third company, cofounded with Gina Bianchini.  We enable you to &lt;em&gt;create your own social network for anything&lt;/em&gt; -- in two minutes, for free.  Think of it as creating your own MySpace, Facebook, or Youtube -- but around any topic you want, with whatever set of features you want, and as public or private as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are using Ning today to create and run social networks around practically every topic you can possibly think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as of today, they (you) have created more than 200,000 networks on Ning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pmarca.typepad.com/files/ning_200k_networks.jpg"&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the significance of 200,000 social networks to Ning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of networks is our &lt;strong&gt;primary public metric&lt;/strong&gt;, both because it's important in its own right -- the more networks on Ning, the more new people who are drawn to Ning to join an existing network and then perhaps create networks of their own -- and because it's a leading indicator of overall usage of Ning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're experiencing 0.5%+ day-over-day growth of number of networks on Ning, which means that we're adding more than 1,000 new networks per day -- and that's accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, at our current growth rate, we'll cross &lt;em&gt;300,000&lt;/em&gt; networks in a matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based both on this rapid creation of new networks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; rapidly increasing use of existing networks, we are seeing even stronger growth in number of registered users (1.0%+ per day) and page views (1.5%+ per day), as well as uniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some additional interesting facts that come out of this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 70% of the networks on Ning are active, as defined by "used in the last 30 days".  This is a considerably &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; percentage than we would have thought when we created the service, given that we make it so easy to create a network that you can do it in two minutes, for free -- I would have assumed there would be more throwaways.  It turns out that people really like using social networks!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;As that "70% active" statistic indicates, the long tail is most definitely alive and well on Ning -- activity on the system as a whole is spread out broadly across the base of active networks.  This continues even as the largest networks on Ning are getting &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; larger than ever before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are now more -- actually, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more -- social networks on Ning than there are on the rest of the Internet in total, including &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the other services that let you create your own social network combined (i.e., all of our honorable competitors combined).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our growth rate continues to accelerate as the overall penetration of social networking across the Internet expands.  As more and more people all over the world use social networking -- including the big one-size-fits-all social networking services that many people use first -- people become more interested in creating and using their own social networks for many topics that they care about.  This is a very large market, and it's growing very fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, fewer than 1% of our current networks fall into the adult category -- a number that's frankly surprisingly low, but one with which we're just fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've never experienced Ning, feel free to give it a shot by either going to the &lt;a href="http://ning.com"&gt;Ning home page&lt;/a&gt; -- from which you can create your own social network with a few clicks -- or explore the &lt;a href="http://blog.ning.com/"&gt;Ning Blog&lt;/a&gt; to see lots of examples of social networks on Ning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makin' progress, makin' progress...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proclaiming the web "just as important as TV" for kids, Disney CEO Robert Iger urged fellow executives on Wednesday to join the digital revolution--or hire people who can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Hire new people," Iger declared to nervous laughter during a morning keynote...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iger also impelled media companies and marketers to shed their protectionist [hostile, enraged, psychotic, litigious, counterproductive, foaming-at-the-mouth] stances on new and emerging technologies. "Most classic brand managers look at technology with a deep-rooted aversion [fear, loathing, dismay, anger, denial, Future Shock]," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Technology is good," he said [shortly before he was hit by a mysterious lightning strike from above], explaining how it allows brands to distribute more broadly, and to be more relevant in the marketplace. "You have to keep the consumer in mind and use technology to do that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond corporate strategy, Iger took time on Wednesday to regale the audience of new- and old-media types with his personal adventures in online media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He admitted to having a Facebook page, but only two friends in the hot social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's important for executives to experience all of this," Iger said...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iger said his presence was more established within Club Penguin, the virtual world for kids that Disney acquired last August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I've got some pretty cool stuff in my igloo"--which, he said, boasts a flat-screen TV, a fireplace, and a basketball hoop. "I've never been to an igloo with a basketball hoop, which is pretty great."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, elsewhere in the space/time continuum, the 2015 Bob Iger is giving another speech: "The web is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more important than TV for kids."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There goes another illusion shattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2008/03/13/quote_du_jour_t_3.html"&gt;Paul Kedrosky&lt;/a&gt; for pointing out the choice sentence in the story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret to making money was borrowing massive sums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Capital Corp. said late Wednesday that it expects that its lenders will seize its assets, causing the likely liquidation of the fund. "Although it has been working diligently with its lenders, the Company has not been able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement to stabilize its financing," the fund said in a statement. [Well, thank heavens they were "working diligently" and not just slacking off.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund's likely collapse is a major black eye for Carlyle Group, the powerful Washington, D.C.-based private-equity firm whose executives own 15% of the fund [but not a big enough black eye that they felt the need to put up more capital and bail it out]...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news comes just one week after Carlyle Group had pleaded with some of the world's largest banks to hold off on margin calls and the liquidation of its mortgage assets. Several of the lenders, led by Deustche Bank and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. ignored Carlyle's request. Wednesday night, they began selling the fund's $21.7 billion in mortgage securities, which were committed as collateral against huge borrowings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Monday, dealers had sold $5.7 billion of the fund's $21.7 billion in assets, which were committed as collateral against huge borrowings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other dealers that sold off Carlyle Capital's collateral included Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Bear Stearns Cos., according to people familiar with the fund. But some other dealers who didn't sell, including Citigroup Inc., had hoped to resolve the fund's crisis amicably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund's collapse shows how Wall Street's biggest players have begun playing hardball with some of their best clients. And they reveal how jittery banks have become about their own loan exposures. In the case of Carlyle, 12 banks had lent the fund about $21 billion, or $20 for every dollar of initial capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Here's the really cool part:] It also illustrates how the credit crunch has moved far beyond subprime mortgages. Carlyle Capital's portfolio consisted exclusively of $21.7 billion of triple-AAA mortgage backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They are considered to have the implied guarantee of the U.S. government and pay par at maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Capital's investment strategy looked like easy money at first. The fund would exploit the difference between the interest earned on its investments in mortgage securities and the costs of financing those investments. [What could possibly go wrong?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret to making money was borrowing massive sums. Carlyle Capital managed only $670 million in client money, but used borrowings to boost its portfolio of bonds to $21.7 billion. Until the dealers started selling off the fund's collateral, it was about 32 times leveraged, a level one mortgage-company analyst called "astronomical."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a interview two years ago, [Eliot] Spitzer, then-attorney general [and now governor, at least for the next few minutes], told ABC News he had some advice for people who break the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Never talk when you can nod, and never nod when you can wink, and never write an email because it's death. You're giving prosecutors all the evidence we need," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Source: &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4424507&amp;page=1"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately 8:12 p.m... LEWIS [the madam] received a call from Client-9 [Spitzer]. During the call, LEWIS told Client-9 that the "package" [cash] did not arrive today. LEWIS asked Client-9 if there was a return address on the envelope, and Client-9 said no. LEWIS asked: "You had [the correct address]...," and Client-9 said: "Yup, same as in the past, no question about it." LEWIS asked Client-9 what time he was interested in having the appointment [illegal hooker sex] tomorrow. Client-9 told her 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately 8:23 p.m., LEWIS called Client-9, and told him that the [her boss] said he [Spitzer] could not proceed with the appointment [illegal hooker sex] with his available credit. After discussing ways to resolve the situation, LEWIS and Client-9 I agreed to speak the following day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately 3:20 p.m... LEWIS... received a call from Client-9. During the call, LEWIS told Client-9 that they were still trying to determine if his deposit had arrived. Client-9 told LEWIS that he had made a reservation at the hotel, and had paid for it in his [fake] name. Client-9 said that there would be a key waiting for her, and told LEWIS that what he had on account with her covered the "transportation" (believed to be a reference to the cost of the trainfare for "Kristen" from New York to Washington, D.C.)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At approximately 4:58 p.m... LEWIS... received an incoming call from Client-9. During the call, LEWIS told Client-9 that his package arrived today, and Client-9 said good. LEWIS asked Client-9 what time he was expecting to have the appointment. Client-9 told LEWIS maybe 10:00 p.m. or so, and asked who it was. LEWIS said it was "Kristen," and Client-9 said "great, okay, wonderful." LEWIS told Client-9 that she would give him a final price later, and asked Client-9 whether he could give "Kristen" "extra funds" at this appointment in order to avoid payment issues in the future. Client-9 said maybe, and that he would see if he could do that. LEWIS explained that the agency did not want a model accepting funds for a future appointment, but that she was going to make an exception that way a deposit could be made so that he would have a credit, and they would not have to "go through this" next time. Client-9 said perfect, and that he would call her regarding the room number...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[During the next phone call] Client-9 asked LEWIS to remind him what 'Kristen" looked like, and LEWIS said that she was an American, petite, very pretty brunette, 5 feet 5 inches, and 105 pounds. Client-9 said that she should go straight to [hotel room] 871...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at least he didn't write any emails.&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;I've tried very hard to keep politics out of this blog -- despite nearly overpowering impulses to the contrary -- for two reasons: one, there's no reason to alienate people who don't share my political views, as wrong-headed as those people may clearly be; two, there's no reason to expect my opinion on political issues should be any more valid than any other reader of what, these days, passes for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;That said, in light of the extraordinary events playing out around us right now in the runup to the presidential election, I would like to share with you a personal experience that I was lucky enough to have early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Early in 2007, a friend of mine who is active in both high-tech and politics called me up and said, let's go see this first-term Senator, Barack Obama, who's ramping up to run for President.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And so we did -- my friend, my wife Laura, and me -- and we were able to meet privately with Senator Obama for an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I think you may find this interesting is that our meeting in early 2007 was probably one of the last times Senator Obama was able to spend an hour and a half sitting down and talking with just about &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; -- so I think we got a solid look at what he's like up close, right before he entered the "bubble" within which all major presidential candidates, and presidents, must exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get disclaimers out of the way: my only involvement with the Democratic presidential campaigns is as an individual donor -- after meeting with the Senator, my wife and I both contributed the maximum amount of "hard money" we could to the Obama campaign, less than $10,000 total for both the primary and the general election.  On the other hand, we also donated to Mitt Romney's Republican primary effort -- conclude from that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I carried four distinct impressions away from our meeting with Senator Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, this is a &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; guy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent time with a lot of politicians in the last 15 years.  Most of them talk &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; you.  Listening is not their strong suit -- in fact, many of them aren't even very good at faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Obama, in contrast, comes across as a normal human being, with a normal interaction style, and a normal level of interest in the people he's with and the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to have an actual, honest-to-God conversation, back and forth, on a number of topics.  In particular, the Senator was personally interested in the rise of social networking, Facebook, Youtube, and user-generated content, and casually but persistently grilled us on what we thought the next generation of social media would be and how social networking might affect politics -- with no staff present, no prepared materials, no notes.  He already knew a fair amount about the topic but was very curious to actually learn more.  We also talked about a pretty wide range of other issues, including Silicon Valley and various political topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;With most politicians, their curiosity ends once they find out how much money you can raise for them.  Not so with Senator Obama -- this is a normal guy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, this is a &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; guy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up for two reasons.  One, Senator Obama's political opponents tend to try to paint him as some kind of lightweight, which he most definitely is not.  Two, I think he's at or near the top of the scale of intelligence of anyone in political life today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;You can see how smart he is in his background -- for example, lecturer in constitutional law at University of Chicago; before that, president of the Harvard Law Review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But it's also apparent when you interact with him that you're dealing with one of the intellectually smartest national politicians in recent times, at least since Bill Clinton.  He's crisp, lucid, analytical, and clearly assimilates and synthesizes a very large amount of information -- smart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a radical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This is not some kind of liberal revolutionary who is intent on throwing everything up in the air and starting over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Put the primary campaign speeches aside; take a look at his policy positions on any number of issues and what strikes you is how reasonable, moderate, and thoughtful they are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;And in person, that's exactly what he's like.  There's no fire in the eyes to realize some utopian or revolutionary dream.  Instead, what comes across -- in both his questions and his answers -- is calmness, reason, and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the first credible post-Baby Boomer presidential candidate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The Baby Boomers are best defined as the generation that came of age during the 1960's -- whose worldview and outlook was shaped by Vietnam plus the widespread social unrest and change that peaked in the late 1960's.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Boomers are those of us, like me, who came of age in the 1970's or 1980's -- after Vietnam, after Nixon, after the "sexual revolution" and the cultural wars of the 1960's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Senator Obama comes across as so fresh and different is that he's the first serious presidential candidate who isn't either from the World War II era (Reagan, Bush Sr, Dole, and even McCain, who was born in 1936) or from the Baby Boomer generation (Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Al Gore, and George W. Bush).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;He's a post-Boomer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Boomers I know are still fixated on the 1960's in one way or another -- generally in how they think about social change, politics, and the government.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;It's very clear when interacting with Senator Obama that he's totally focused on the world as it has existed since &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the 1960's -- as am I, and as is practically everyone I know who's younger than 50.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the picture that emerges from these four impressions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Smart, normal, curious, not radical, and post-Boomer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;If you were asking me to write a capsule description of what I would look for in the next President of the United States, that would be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Having met him and then having watched him for the last 12 months run one of the best-executed and cleanest major presidential campaigns in recent memory, I have no doubt that Senator Obama has the judgment, bearing, intellect, and high ethical standards to be an outstanding president -- completely aside from the movement that has formed around him, and in complete contradition to the silly assertions by both the Clinton and McCain campaigns that he's somehow not ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before I close, let me share two specific things he said at the time -- early 2007 -- on the topic of whether he's ready.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We asked him directly, &lt;em&gt;how concerned should we be that you haven't had meaningful experience as an executive -- as a manager and leader of people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;He said, watch how I run my campaign -- you'll see my leadership skills in action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I wasn't sure what to make of his answer -- political campaigns are often very messy and chaotic, with a lot of turnover and flux; what conclusions could we possibly draw from one of those?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as any political expert will tell you, it turns out that the Obama campaign has been one of the best organized and executed presidential campaigns in memory.  Even Obama's opponents concede that his campaign has been disciplined, methodical, and effective across the full spectrum of activities required to win -- and with a minimum of the negative campaigning and attack ads that normally characterize a race like this, and with almost no staff turnover.  By almost any measure, the Obama campaign has simply out-executed both the Clinton and McCain campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This speaks well to the Senator's ability to run a campaign, but speaks even more to his ability to recruit and manage a top-notch group of campaign professionals and volunteers -- another key leadership characteristic.  When you compare this to the awe-inspiring discord, infighting, and staff turnover within both the Clinton and McCain campaigns up to this point -- well, let's just say it's a very interesting data point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We then asked, &lt;em&gt;well, what about foreign policy -- should we be concerned that you just don't have much experience there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;He said, directly, two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;First, he said, I'm on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where I serve with a number of Senators who are widely regarded as leading experts on foreign policy -- and I can tell you that I know as much about foreign policy at this point as most of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Being a fan of blunt answers, I liked that one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;But then he made what I think is the really good point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;He said -- and I'm going to paraphrase a little here: &lt;em&gt;think about who I am&lt;/em&gt; -- my father was Kenyan; I have close relatives in a small rural village in Kenya to this day; and I spent several years of my childhood living in Jakarta, Indonesia.  Think about what it's going to mean in many parts of the world -- parts of the world that we really care about -- when I show up as the President of the United States.  I'll be fundamentally changing the world's perception of what the United States is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;He's got my vote.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From well-regarded television industry journalist and future blogger &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/business/media/25abc.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1204088400&amp;en=bf40f56bc53d308f&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin"&gt;Bill Carter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to strike a blow against the proliferation of digital video recorders, the ABC network, its affiliated broadcast stations, and Cox Communications’ cable systems are establishing an on-demand video service that would allow viewers to watch ABC shows like “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives” any time they choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch: It uses a new technology that disables the viewers’ ability to fast-forward through commercials...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several executives involved in the project, which ABC plans to offer to other cable systems around the country, said the move was an overt attempt to staunch the use of DVRs like TiVo, which viewers often use to avoid commercials. That activity is increasingly seen as threat to broadcast television, which depends on ad revenue to pay for programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This does counter the DVR,” said Anne Sweeney, the president of the Disney-ABC television group. “You don’t need TiVo if you have fast-forward-disabled video on demand..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Cole, president of Citadel Communications, which owns three local ABC stations, who is also the chairman of the board of affiliated ABC stations, was even more direct about the goal of the new service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As network and affiliates, we both have an interest in slowing down the explosive growth of DVRs,” Mr. Cole said. “This is about combating DVRs. As we developed this at every stage, there was an agreement that however we put this together, disabling the fast-forward function was key.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four large newspaper companies are joining forces to sell advertisements on the Internet, hoping that the combined heft of their Web sites will encourage large advertisers to spend more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the four companies — the Tribune Company, the Gannett Company, the Hearst Corporation and The New York Times Company — is transferring a portion of its online ad space to quadrantONE, a new company that will be announced Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the joint venture, which will be based in Chicago and will hire 17 people [commitment!], is to let national advertisers place ads on local Web sites with a single phone call [phone call!].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sites belong to papers like The Los Angeles Times (which is a Tribune property), The Des Moines Register (Gannett), The Houston Chronicle (Hearst) and The Boston Globe (The New York Times Company).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies’ flagship sites, however, will not be included, because they are not considered local. These include the sites of USA Today, a Gannett paper, and of The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune, which are owned by the Times Company. [These are also known as the ones that actually have reasonable numbers of readers.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives involved said the newspaper companies understand [by which they mean, "used to have a local monopoly but don't anymore"] the local market better than Google, Yahoo and Microsoft...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies were also all part of the New Century Network in the late 1990s...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 1998:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[W]hen New Century Network was kicked off last April by nine [newspaper] giants teaming up to conquer electronic competition, even the launch party bombed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a ballroom at the Newspaper Association of America convention in Chicago, a thousand bottles of champagne emblazoned with ''New Century Network: The Collective Intelligence of America's Newspapers'' awaited the hordes expected to come to toast the watershed new-media joint venture. When fewer than 100 people showed up, Chief Executive Lee de Boer made an abbreviated speech before retreating...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reception was the first public humiliation for New Century Network, but only one in a series of blunders that culminated in the company's abrupt shutdown on Mar. 10. Created in 1995 to unite newspapers against Microsoft Corp. and other competitors girding to woo electronically advertisers and readers, New Century Network came to embody everything that could go wrong when old-line newspapers converge with new media...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started with $1 million each from Knight-Ridder, Tribune, Times Mirror, Advance Publications, Cox Enterprises, Gannett, Hearst, Washington Post, and New York Times, New Century seemed an entrepreneurial dream. The Internet had just opened to the world, creating vast new competition for readers--and for the advertisers that pump $40 billion into newspapers. But it also gave newspapers a chance to capture national accounts that favored the one-stop-shopping convenience of TV and national magazines...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[T]he [newspaper] companies had wildly diverging philosophies about how newspapers should make the electronic leap and what role the new venture should play. ''You had private companies and public companies and companies that were risk-averse and those that were risk-tolerant,'' says Harry Chandler, head of new media for Los Angeles Times. ''You had big-city papers and small chains. We shared a need. But it was frustrating trying to come together.''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the wired world moved at warp speed, New Century spent 18 months hiring a permanent ceo and two years creating an electronic doorway to 140 newspapers... ''This [Internet] thing is really racing,'' says Al Sikes, the former Federal Communications Commissioner who is president of Hearst New Media. ''Organizations of a number of co-equals can't turn on a dime.''...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partners ultimately invested more than $25 million in the virtual venture... The board decided... to pull the plug, coming to a remarkably quick agreement--for the first and final time...&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;It's not me, I swear...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Some big companies have had a surprise during their earnings conference calls this quarter...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;At least seven times just the past three weeks, a mystery caller has cleverly insinuated himself into the normally well-manicured ritual of the quarterly calls...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"Congratulations on the solid numbers -- you always seem to come through in challenging times," he said to Leo Kiely, president and chief executive officer of Molson Coors Brewing Co., on Feb. 12, convincingly parroting the obsequious banter common to the calls. "Can you provide some more color as to what you are doing for your supply chain initiatives to reduce manufacturing costs per hectoliter, as you originally promised $150 million in synergy or savings to decrease working capital?"&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;...[M]any CEO's have had... trouble telling the difference. Most have gamely tried to answer the questions. Mr. Kiely and two other Molson executives stuck politely with the caller through three detailed follow-ups. Timothy Wolf, the company's global chief financial officer, closed by telling him, "We think we will have some more positive encouraging things to share with you next month in New York," according to a transcript of the call...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Executives at PepsiCo Inc., Dean Foods Co., Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and others have had similar experiences since around mid-January...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;[A]nnoyed executives and analysts are wondering why someone would want to play a game with dry business calls that normally follow a tightly controlled formula -- unless the game is the whole point. They can't figure out how the caller is getting any benefit from so closely mimicking them. "If he was spoofing I would hope he'd be funnier," says Bill Schmitz, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;[Mr. Schmitz has perhaps not been listening to the usual questions on such calls all that carefully.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;"Our quarterly earnings calls are key opportunities to [sic] us to interact with the investment community and to explain our results," says a Newell Rubbermaid spokesman, David Doolittle. "Anyone who would come on the call and use some of that time unproductively is disruptive."&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;[Mr. Doolittle then threatened to spank the mystery caller with a Newell Rubbermaid spatula.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann said rating downgrades for bond insurers [and the presumed resulting collapse in prices of bonds insured by those insurers] pose risks that could match the U.S. subprime market collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It could be a tsunami-like event comparable to subprime," Ackermann said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Frankfurt today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, is "well positioned" on its risk from bond insurers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just the last few weeks, The San Diego Union-Tribune eliminated more than 100 jobs, one-tenth of its work force. The Chicago Sun-Times began a major round of newsroom layoffs, then put itself up for sale, and publishers in Minneapolis and Philadelphia warned that tough economics could force cuts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, news like that would have drawn much commentary and hand-wringing in the newspaper business, but in the last few months, reductions have become so routine that they barely make a ripple outside each paper’s hometown. Since mid-2007, major downsizing — often coupled with grim financial reports — has been imposed at The San Francisco Chronicle, The Seattle Times, The San Jose Mercury News, USA Today and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk of newspapers’ demise is older than some of the reporters who write about it, but what is happening now is something new, something more serious than anyone has experienced in generations. Last year started badly and ended worse, with shrinking profits and tumbling stock prices, and 2008 is shaping up as more of the same, prompting louder talk about a dark turning point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m an optimist, but it is very hard to be positive about what’s going on,” said Brian P. Tierney, publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News. “The next few years are transitional, and I think some papers aren’t going to make it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising, the source of more than 80 percent of newspaper revenue, traditionally rose and fell with the overall economy. But in the last 12 to 18 months, that link has been broken, and executives do not expect to be able to repair it completely anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, combined print and online ad revenue fell about 7 percent. In the last six decades, only one other year — 2001, when there was a recession — had a steeper decline, according to the Newspaper Association of America. Adjusted for inflation, 2007 ad revenue was more than 20 percent below its peak in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circulation revenue has declined steadily since 2003, and the number of copies sold has been slipping about 2 percent a year. Some of the largest papers — including The San Francisco Chronicle, The Boston Globe and The Los Angeles Times — have lost 30 to 40 percent of their circulation in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-term shift of advertising to the Internet — especially classified ads for things like jobs, cars and houses — accelerated last year. The real estate downturn hit the newspaper business hard, especially in California and Florida, where real estate ads fell more than 20 percent at some newspapers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of the industry — including many executives within it [and the occasional blogger] — say that newspapers have done a poor job adapting to the Internet and working creatively and aggressively to sell ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Tierney agrees, “but you could change that and still be sliding,” he said. “When everyone’s taking on water, you can’t expect to stay dry — only less wet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is in sharp contrast to his tone in 2006, when he led a group of investors who paid $515 million for the two Philadelphia papers. Back then, Mr. Tierney dismissed the industry’s gloomy talk, expressing confidence that it could win back paying readers and advertisers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling stock prices made newspapers look like tempting targets to some buyers in 2006 and early 2007, but even then, the prices of the transactions that did take place were seen as inflated, and there was little interest from other potential bidders. McClatchy bought the Knight Ridder chain, and the News Corporation bought Dow Jones &amp; Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Many papers were sold in smaller deals, including the Philadelphia dailies, The San Jose Mercury News and The Star Tribune of Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share prices have continued to fall since then, and analysts think they will go lower still. But since last spring, the supply of buyers seems to have dried up...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://blog.pmarca.com/">&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is read the latest Societe Generale headlines!&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Société Générale says it lost 4.9 billion Euros ($7.17 billion) at the hands of 31-year-old trader Jérôme Kerviel. Now, the embattled French bank could face another financial hit -- this time from the tax man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As they pore over the trades, financial books and mobile-phone records of Mr. Kerviel, Société Générale officials have discovered that the trader booked a real gain for the bank of €1.4 billion by the end of last year...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;That profit now "is subject to corporate tax," according to one person close to the bank. "We will argue against it, but fiscal authorities will want their share," this person said...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;When it announced the world's biggest trading loss on Jan. 24, Société Générale said that Mr. Kerviel for several months had engaged in risky and fraudulent trading that at one point had left the bank exposed by 50 billion Euros. The bank at that time said that Mr. Kerviel's trading positions had fluctuated and that as of late last year, his portfolio showed a "virtual" gain of 1.4 billion Euros.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said it hadn't noticed the gain because the trader had hidden it by creating a set of fake positions that generated a 1.4 billion Euros loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Now, however, officials have discovered that as of the end of last year, Mr. Kerviel had unwound almost all of his trading positions -- and in fact had locked in a real gain of 1.4 billion Euros for the bank...&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;
