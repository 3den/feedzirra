			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://myskitch.com/ianclarke/dock-20071101-092803.jpg" align="left" height="80" width="80" />Thoof users may have noticed a marked increase in low-quality &#8220;spam&#8221; stories over the past few weeks.  While our targeting algorithm does identify and bias against such stories, the shier volume of them resulted in many of them being visible for quite a while. So we have implemented some more aggressive anti-spam measures, to identify both spam stories, and users with a track-record of submitting spam.</p>
<p>We are happy that many people have identified Thoof as a good source of traffic, but we are only interested in sending traffic to those that have earned it by providing interesting content.  This doesn&#8217;t include blatantly promotional posts (ie. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t our website great!!&#8221;), or posts to blogs which simply embed or link elsewhere without adding any real value.</p>
<p>You can help this process by using the &#8220;mark as&#8221; drop down on stories to mark such stories as &#8220;spam&#8221;.</p>
<p>We hope that you see an immediate improvement in story quality, please post comments and feedback below.</p>

Here are some of the more interesting observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahoo Mail users were 15% more likely to click on a story about cellphones relative to GMail users (a stat that may change rapidly if rumors of a Google cell phone prove to be accurate), and 5% more interested in stories about phones in general</li>
<li>Yahoo users were also the more frugal of the two, expressing a 4% bias in favor of stories about personal finance, and a 6% bias in favor of stories about savings</li>
<li>Lastly, Yahoo users seem to be more interested in fitness, expressing a 9% bias over GMail users</li>
</ul>
<p>And what interests GMail users?</p>
<ul>
<li>GMail users seem far more interested in politics, expressing a 6% bias in favor of stories about the Bush Administration, 4% in favor of stories about Hillary Clinton, a 7% bias in favor of stories about Afghanistan, and a 5% bias in favor of stories about Iran</li>
<li>GMail users also seem more academic and technical, expressing a 4% bias in favor of stories about Physics, Mathematics, and Computing, and a 5% bias in favor of stories about Programming</li>
<li>Lastly, GMail users seem to be more likely to be fans of Flickr, expressing a 4% bias in favor of stories about that website</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have any explanations for these biases?</p>

<p>This works with our editing functionality, so that if more than one user marks a story, we can quickly clean up and fix these posts.  All with your help!</p>

<p>At the heart of <a href="http://thoof.com/">Thoof</a> is a sophisticated technology which looks for patterns in user behavior.  This is how we are able to tailor the stories you see right from the very first moment you visit <a href="http://thoof.com/">thoof.com</a>.</p>
<p>So, we decided to ask <a href="http://thoof.com/">Thoof</a> about the real differences are between Mac and Windows users, the results are rather surprising to say the least!</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems that Windows users are 20% more interested in stories about religion than Mac users.  Could it be that the occasional brush with a &#8220;blue screen of death&#8221; gives the Windows user a greater sense of their own mortality?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Windows users are 39% more likely to read a story about personal savings than their Mac using friends</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mac users are 6% more interested in intellectual property law, and 5% more interested in fitness</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mac users are 20% more interested in stories about Biology</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Windows users are 11% less likely to be Pittsburgh Steelers fans</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mac users are 6% less likely to read a story involving New York</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are your theories as to the reasons behind these patterns in user behavior?  We look forward to reading your comments.</p>
