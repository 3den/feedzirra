I believe my toes are still numb from yesterday&#8217;s Inauguration; but my heart is warm for two distinct reasons:

<p>I believe my toes are still numb from yesterday&#8217;s Inauguration; but my heart is warm for two distinct reasons:</p>
<p>The first was the sight of people dancing the The Presidential Anthem (&#8217;Hail to the Chief&#8217;) for the first time in my lifetime (maybe ever?). &#8216;Hail to the Chief&#8217; has always seemed somewhat inappropriate to me: not because we shouldn&#8217;t revere our President, and give him the respect the Constitution allows him, but because the march seemed to highlight the outsized amount of Power held by such unfitting men.</p>
<p>When Obama exited the steps of the Capitol and the band struck up, people danced all around me. &#8220;Change We Could Believe In&#8221; became &#8220;Power We Can Celebrate.&#8221; It&#8217;s a newer, smarter Power, and I look forward to seeing it in action.</p>
<p>And if we are ready to dance to &#8220;Hail to the Chief&#8221; I think we should be ready to sweat to our National Anthem.</p>
<p>The second reason I am so moved is because I believe the call to National Service made yesterday will be met by my fellow Americans. Obama renewed the call for us to tackle our Nation&#8217;s problems as if it was effort like going to the moon. To step up, &#8220;not because it is easy, but because it is hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe my work with the NY Tech Meetup is one form of service: hopefully our work will help create jobs and a stronger industry will stimulate technological advances which are good for all people.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough. So, this weekend I am going to start orientation to become a Big Brother. I&#8217;ve chosen <a title="Big Brothers Big Sisters NYC" href="http://www.bigsnyc.org/">Big Brothers and Big Sisters of NY</a> (over great programs like <a title="Camp Interactive" href="http://www.campinteractive.org/">Camp Interactive</a>) for <a title="Big Brother Westheimer" href="http://innonate.com/2007/02/14/big-night-out-and-the-big-brothers-and-big-sisters-legacy/">personal reasons</a> (see below), but there are so many ways to serve society and this Country. I&#8217;m sure many of you already do serve in some way (and many work to serve their families in a way which cannot allow more work); but if you do not yet serve in some way, consider Obama&#8217;s call to service, and consider joining me and sweating to the National Anthem.</p>
<p><a href="http://innonate.com/images/irvin_nixon.png"><img class="alignnone" title="Irvin Big Brother" src="http://innonate.com/images/irvin_nixon_sm.png" alt="" width="377" height="377" /></a></p>
<p><em>Personal Note: I’ll point you to the inspiring story of America’s first Big Brother, as <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.cincypost.com/living/1999/west042699.html');" href="http://www.cincypost.com/living/1999/west042699.html">reported in the Cincinnati Post</a> in 1999.</em></p>
<p><em>Here’s an excerpt:</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>The phrase ‘All men are created equal’ echoed in [Irvin] Westheimer’s mind, fresh from a re-reading of the Declaration of Independence that began his day. But the pitiful scene in the downtown alley struck him as a bleak contrast to Jefferson’s powerful eloquence.</em></p>
<p><em> Westheimer ran downstairs and introduced himself. The boy, friendly but somewhat wary, said his name was Tom.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>That <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvin_F._Westheimer');" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvin_F._Westheimer">Irvin Westheimer</a>, seen below presenting Richard Nixon with a plaque naming him an Honorary Big Brother, was my Great Grandfather.

<p>The Inauguration of Barack Hussein Obama as our Nation&#8217;s 44th President is an event I&#8217;ve waited a lifetime to see.</p>
<p>That I was also a part of the campaign to elect him President &#8212; exhausting myself beyond points I knew I could bare &#8212; makes the occasion all the more joyous. I am overwhelmed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a release. Today, I have Hope for my country like nothing I&#8217;ve felt before. I&#8217;m sure many of you do too.</p>
<p>But what about all those who aren&#8217;t here to celebrate with us? I&#8217;ve lived only 25 years &#8212; and fought too few battles &#8212; to see this sight. Too many people to count lived entire lives &#8212; and fought every day of them &#8212; and won&#8217;t have the honor of watching Obama raise his hand and take the greatest Oath in our Land.</p>
<p>As we watch this sight, these are some of the people I wish could be here - in this life. It is to these people I dedicate my experience, seeing Obama become President:</p>
<ul>
<li>My grandfather, <a title="Robert Westheimer" href="http://www.cincinnatichamber.com/cham_a.aspx?menu_id=144&amp;id=1102">Robert Westheimer</a> (1916 - 1997), who fought for civil rights and the dignity of his fellow citizen.</li>
<li>My great aunt and uncle, May and Charles Westheimer, who were also fearless civic leaders.</li>
<li>My mother&#8217;s friend and a friend to me, <a href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-716-cheryl-wallace.html">Cheryl Wallace</a>, an artist with an acute sense of justice who died in 2006.</li>
<li>Richard Sugarman and Joe Sherman, fathers to two of my closest friends, who worked hard and believed in the promise of America for their children.</li>
<li><a title="Paul Wellstone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wellstone">Paul Wellstone</a>, the first politician I saw embody the politics Obama champions.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Tubbs_Jones">Stephanie Tubbs Jones</a>, Ohio&#8217;s pride, and first Black Congresswoman.</li>
<li>Justice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a>, namesake of <a href="http://brandeis.edu/">my alma mater</a>, who reminds the &#8220;Yes We Did&#8221; generation that, &#8220;<span class="body">The most important political office is that of the private citizen.</span> &#8220;</li>
<li>Bob Marley, who sang for equal rights.</li>
<li>Woody Guthrie, who sang for worker&#8217;s rights.</li>
<li>Martin Luther King, Jr., who &#8220;walked so Obama could run.&#8221;</li>
<li>Eleanor Roosevelt, who said, &#8220;Yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery, today is a gift.&#8221; Today <em><strong>is</strong></em> a gift.</li>
<li>President Lyndon Johnson, who &#8212; as a tough negotiator &#8212; signed the Civil Rights Act.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I awoke this morning with very strong feelings.</p>
<p><strong><em>One week.</em></strong></p>
<p>It weighed on me. <em>Today&#8217;s Tuesday. Next Tuesday Barack Obama will be President.</em></p>
<p>As I got out of bed and got ready for work, I thought back so something Michelle Obama <a title="underdog" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/15/michelle_obama_were_underdogs.html">said</a> a matter-of-factly times during the campaign season &#8212; her word still rang true to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Barack Obama will be the underdog until he is sitting in the White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>One week, and Barack Obama &#8212; and everything he stands for &#8212; is still the underdog.</p>
<p>Getting this far was the unlikely story of <em>my</em> lifetime. Seeing Barack Obama speak at the 2004 convention, and then knowing he <em>should</em> be the next President, only to then become a part of that unlikely story and successfully change politics &#8212; it&#8217;s almost too much for a 25 year old to reconcile.</p>
<p>Were we, as underdog believers in a Different Democracy &#8212; a Country throwing itself at the Future, rather than hiding and fighting under the cloak of its past &#8212; really successful in our efforts to Change the world and elect Barack Obama? Will he, sometime in the early afternoon of January 20th, 2009, really sit in the White House?</p>
<p>Will our ideals go from underdog to topdog?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>The fight for affordable healthcare, equitable taxation, Smart Power, green power, vibrant educational and competitive technological systems has just begun.</p>
<p>We were underdogs for this chance. But now we have our chance.</p>
<p>So, this week, let us celebrate &#8212; one last time &#8212; this accomplishment. Let us dance and sign one last time. The fight was hard and the victory was sweet. We won the Chance to Change.</p>
<p>But next week &#8212; one week from today &#8212; let&#8217;s get to work.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit biased here (I used to consult with NewsHour through my work with National Public Media) &#8212; and I&#8217;ll write more about effectively using Twitter in forthcoming blog posts &#8212; but I wanted to point people to this recent tweet by <a title="@NewsHour" href="http://twitter.com/newshour">@NewsHour</a>.</p>
<p>Most media organizations do two things wrong on Twitter.</p>
<p>They use their Twitter accounts to only to broadcast links to their stories.</p>
<p>They act like the Twitter account is somehow the voice of the outlet itself, rather than the voice of a real employee (who, in turn, is a real person).</p>
<p>From the start, NewsHour has done the right thing on Twitter. Not only do they tell people to watch other outlets when it&#8217;s best for their followers (see above referral to CSPAN, as well as this <a title="NewsHour and NPR" href="http://twitter.com/NewsHour/statuses/1086674221">referral to NPR</a>) but they also tweet with a human voice.</p>
<p><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wRdpGr4UmUg/SWOFBErMQyI/AAAAAAAAAdI/O7DoqQe9jvo/s800/IMG_0811.JPG" alt="Team NewsHour" width="188" height="141" align="right" />I still remember <a title="Newshour tweet" href="http://twitter.com/NewsHour/statuses/900013713">this tweet</a> from the Democratic Convention, when Online NewsHour Anna Shoup went on the convention floor (shortly after I had been hanging out with the NewsHour crew in one of the media tents (photo right).</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="entry-content" style="display: block;">floor access closed unless you have a seat. I don&#8217;t. Outside rim s till packed </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="entry-content" style="display: block;">That was Anna talking. Not some bot.</span></p>
<p><span class="entry-content" style="display: block;">That&#8217;s &#8220;getting&#8221; Twitter.<br />

<p>Silicon Alley Insider <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/12/annoncing-the-fix-diggs-miserable-business-contest">recently issued a challenge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite strong traffic and passionate users, Digg&#8217;s revenues blow. During the first three quarters of 2008, Digg saw about $6.4 million on 30 million monthly uniques and lost $2 million. Yuck.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re launching the Fix Digg&#8217;s Miserable Business Contest.</p>
<p>The winning submission will ideally include steps to implement the plan, revenue projections based on real numbers, helpful visuals (like a deck) and clean prose. We&#8217;ll judge submissions based on their creativity, clarity and plausibility.</p>
<p>The prize? &#8230; We&#8217;ll personally pass the winners&#8217; plan and resume to our friends at Digg: CEO Jay Adelson and founder Kevin Rose.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contest? I love contests! (I also love proposing <a title="Twitter Revenue Model" href="http://innonate.com/2008/06/30/twitter-mobile-payments/">really smart revenue models</a>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, today was the deadline to submit, so I took an hour and I threw up some ideas I&#8217;ve been thinking about in an intentionally cheesy-looking Power Point (see above or <a title="Digg Revenue Model" href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/media/fixing-digg-plan-1">here</a>).</p>
<p>Lo and behold, my deck was <a title="Fix Digg Contest" href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/1/five-plans-to-fix-digg----vote-here">one of the top five</a> selected by Alley Insider today.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t generally try to sound too headstrong, but my idea is really the only reasonable one up there; so, when you vote (<a title="Fix Digg Contest" href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/1/five-plans-to-fix-digg----vote-here">click through to vote</a>), do Digg a favor and vote for my deck (#1).</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, my idea for Digg &#8212; to sell in-line &#8220;Sponsored Article&#8221; listings on a CPC or eCPM basis &#8212; is a really good one: not because it&#8217;s my idea (I refer to it as the &#8220;Techmeme Model,&#8221; so clearly I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s my idea) or because I don&#8217;t think Digg hasn&#8217;t thought of it (how could they not), but because <em><strong>I think it&#8217;s the right thing to do, not only for Digg their bottom line, but also for Digg&#8217;s users</strong></em>!</p>
<p>Going back aways, my friend Charlie posted a idea for a service to &#8220;<a title="Grease this Post" href="http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/2008/07/free-business-p.html">Grease This Post</a>.&#8221; In the article, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>How great would it be if, right next to the publish button, there was another button that said, &#8220;Do you want to invest $10 in driving relevant traffic to this post?&#8221;  The money could be used to not only do search placement, but sponsored placement as &#8220;Suggested sponsored links&#8221; in front of bloggers talking about the same things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen, Charlie.</p>
<p>If Digg allowed brands, publishers, and indy bloggers to &#8220;grease&#8221; their posts and press releases, it would not only command super-high eCPMs for Digg, but also provide a new tool for Digg&#8217;s users.</p>
<p>And Digg doesn&#8217;t have to allianate their users in the process!</p>
<p>Back at FOWA Miami 2008, <a title="Photo Matt" href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> of Wordpress explained that Wordpress <em><strong>does</strong></em> put advertising on its publishers&#8217; pages, but because they only target infrequent visitors, most users never see them.</p>
<p>With Digg, one could assume that only 10% of pageviews come from registered users, and only 1% from hardcore power users (90/10/1 is a common ratio for User Generated Content (UCG) sites like Digg).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s special about Digg, is that while that fat 90% of visitors isn&#8217;t necessarily registered, they <em><strong>are</strong></em> there to discover new content.</p>
<p>This puts Digg is a great position to power <em><strong>paid discovery</strong></em> for publishers and brands and reach a huge majority of users (visitors) without alienating the notoriously Digg-is-a-temple set of power users.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it&#8217;s a great model. To start, Digg would have to build a simple tool for folks to create and target ads with. It should be self-service to begin with and Digg should experiment with CPM and CPC models to see what works best for the advertisers.</p>

(Hat tip <a href="http://msg.tumblr.com/">Michael</a>)</p>
<p>Yeah &#8212; it&#8217;s weird. But it&#8217;s also fun (everyone who tries it giggles while trying it, which is a good sign I think). And it&#8217;s also a way to learn more about the economics of putting applications in the iPhone application store.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the back story:</p>
<p>Before I left for the Obama campaign in October, Naveen and I were getting coffee and got to talking about iPhone applications. What fascinated were the applications which put only a very light layer on top of  the iPhone&#8217;s APIs to create admittedly stupid apps.</p>
<p>What really fascinated us was that people &#8212; including us &#8212; were <em><strong>buying them</strong></em>&#8230; in droves!</p>
<p>So, Naveen and I started brainstorming, and, when we came up with an idea, we ran back to his apartment, set a two hour timer, and emerged with &#8220;Drunk Dialer:&#8221; a phone number dialing application where the buttons jump around as you move. The name &#8220;Drunk Dialer&#8221; refers to the fact that if you&#8217;re drunk, it&#8217;s probably harder to keep the phone still and hit the key you&#8217;re aiming for, thus making it harder for drunk people to make phone calls (which, unless it&#8217;s for a cab, they should be doing).</p>
<p>The interesting thing, however, is not so much the applications as much as the economics.</p>
<p>When the application got accepted to the store, I posted a link on my Tumblr account and Naveen sent a message on Twitter saying that it was available.</p>
<p>Since then, before getting press about it today, it had earned about $150.</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>However, we built the application in only a few hours. And, now that it&#8217;s in the store, we don&#8217;t have to &#8212; though we probably will &#8212; touch it ever again, and it will still produce revenue for us with zero operating cost.</p>
<p>So what are iPhone application economics? Tough to say so far, but it&#8217;s trending towards $40/hr of development, and &#8212; after today &#8212; it&#8217;s only going to get better.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People who <a title="@innonate" href="http://twitter.com/innonate">follow me on Twitter</a> know that most of the links I send have been shortened by <a href="http://bit.ly/">Bitly</a>. However, when &#8220;Tweeting&#8221; a link from my iPhone, it&#8217;s generally difficult to get the URL in my Twitter client to share, let alone shorten it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I solved the problem, connecting Bit.ly, Twitter, and my iPhone so I can send the cool links I find while reading mobilly.</p>
<p><em>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Bit.ly is a NY-based and <a href="http://betaworks.com/">Betaworks</a>-incubated URL shortening service. Because of it&#8217;s rich click-through stats, it&#8217;s simply a tool I could not live without (more on why tracking click-throughs in Twitter is important in a forthcoming blog post).</em></p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Add the bit.ly bookmarklet to Safari</p>
<p><a href="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-952" title="Bitly Bookmarklet" src="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-1-300x137.png" alt="Bitly Bookmarklet" width="300" height="137" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Sync your Safari bookmarks with your iPhone (I use MobileMe so it does it automagically, but you can also do this manually on the &#8220;Info&#8221; tab in iTunes).</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Go back to the page you want to share in your iPhone&#8217;s browser.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Go into your bookmarks and click the &#8220;bit.ly&#8221; bookmark.</p>
<p><a href="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-955" title="Bookmark" src="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/photo.jpg" alt="Bookmark" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Congrats! You now have a shortened link.</p>
<p><a href="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_0001.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-953" title="Shortened Link" src="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_0001.png" alt="Shortened Link" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Type your message, click Sign-in/Post (where you&#8217;ll have to enter your Twitter credentials).</p>
<p><a href="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_0002.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954" title="Type your message" src="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/img_0002.png" alt="Type your message" width="320" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And there you have it! It&#8217;s a great way to use bitly on your iPhone!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Avner Ronen, CEO and Founder of <a title="Boxee" href="http://boxee.tv/">Boxee</a>, just <a title="Boxee CES" href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2009/01/01/last-minute-opportunity-for-boxee-users-at-ces/">posted an interesting offer</a> on the Boxee Blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>we have two locations at CES this year, and 4 of us are going to the show. but we could use some help and thought it may be best to have two users come with us to the show and help us tell people about boxee.</p>
<p>we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>take care of your flight + hotel (Jan 7th - 10th) + food/drinks during the show</li>
<li>equip you with boxee shirts + schwag</li>
</ul>
<p>you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>spend half the day with us giving boxee demos, telling people how boxee rocks, etc.</li>
<li>spend the other half walking the show and checking out all the cool gadgets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a bad deal, eh?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to go to CES and I love Boxee. So, here&#8217;s exactly why I&#8217;d shill for Boxee at CES (starting with a brief video tour of the system):<br />
<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/8920b0d3/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"/><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/8920b0d3/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent" name="viddler" ></embed></object><br />
I truly believe that Boxee is the future of media in your living room.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future?&#8221; you ask. Sure, I know I said the <a title="AppleTV was the future" href="http://innonate.com/2008/05/08/5-things-from-the-future/#appletv">AppleTV was the future</a> of the living room before &#8212; and I still believe it was the first, best way to consume user-generated and web-distributed content in a lean-back environment &#8212; but for the following reasons, Boxee changes everything, and has the opporunity to become, as Fred Wilson <a title="USV Boxee investment" href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2008/11/boxee.html">describes it</a>, the Mozilla &#8220;Firefox of media center software.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Lean Back (in your living room), Open (on anything), and Watch (what you want)</h3>
<p>Boxee rocks because it&#8217;s open source, cross platform, egoless, and in your living room.</p>
<p>Being cross platform is important because it puts the software in your living room to begin with; it&#8217;s installed on my AppleTV, but could just as well be on anything else next or attached to your TV: a MacMini, an old Windows machine, a Linux box, or even a Linux embedded display.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boxee is an open source application (based on another open source project, called XBMC). Being open source means any developer can jump in and build add-ons for their Boxee installation and create a distribution of the software with their modifications (eventually there will be a marketplace for the individual modules, I imagine). This matters because the Boxee team has limited resources &#8212; as does any single entity &#8212; but if a niche group wants to modify Boxee to fit their needs, they can; and then they can share those modifications with you, in your living room.</p>
<p>Anyway, with a model like that &#8212; providing the platform and getting out of the way &#8212; it&#8217;s no wonder they were able to put Hulu (hence Fox, CBS, movie studios, etc), CNN, CBS, Comedy Central, and a dozen other top distributers (not to mention the hundreds of thousands of independent podcasts) on their system in record time.</p>
<p>Simply put, Boxee gives me the content I like where I like it; and, because of their open model, they&#8217;ll be able to deliver that satisfaction going forward.</p>
<h3>Social Discovery = The New Channel Surfing</h3>
<p>Lastly, I believe Boxee ushers in a new era of channel surfing.</p>
<p>Since the invention of the remote control, we&#8217;d sit our our couches, remote in hand, pressing the up button and down button rapidly to find new content.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-943" title="Boxee Recommended" src="http://innonate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-6-1024x640.png" alt="Boxee Recommended" width="419" height="261" /></p>
<p>With Boxee, social discovery is the new channel surfing, because you can build out your social network and see what interesting content your friend may have recently been viewing. Instead of seeing &#8220;what&#8217;s on&#8221; that your cable package provides, you can see &#8220;what&#8217;s on&#8221; that your friends are viewing.
