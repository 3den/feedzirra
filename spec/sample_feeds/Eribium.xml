<p>This was, without a doubt, the best conference I&#8217;ve been too - and the icing on the cake was the leftover £500 behind a students bar afterwards - ginger beers for everyone!</p>
<p><a href="http://effectif.com">Graham Ashton</a> has done a <a href="http://effectif.com/2008/11/22/notes-from-the-ruby-manor">write</a> <a href="http://effectif.com/2008/11/23/notes-from-the-ruby-manor-part-2">up</a> of all the talks and <a href="http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/">Chris Lowis</a> has <a href="http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/2008/11/24/ruby-gsl-pearson.html">converted</a> AAR to use the GNU scientific lib.</p>
<p>I was going to use Slideshare, but they seem to have broken it, so you can download a pdf of the presentation <a href="http://mxm.s3.amazonaws.com/Acts As Recommendable.pdf">here</a> (video will be up soon). The slides don&#8217;t make much sense by themselves though.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a week ago <a href="http://mislav.caboo.se">Mislav Marohnic</a> <a href="http://mislav.caboo.se/rails/excercise-in-csrf/">wrote</a> about a simple CSRF attack on <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/person/13081-alex-maccaw">Working with Rails</a>.</p>
<p>What Mislav exploited was the fact that Working With Rails didn&#8217;t require a POST request to create recommendations, so just by visiting his blog you&#8217;d inadvertadly recommend him (if you were logged into WWR).<br />
In less than 24 hours Mislav got enough recommendations to boost his raking by 10 places.</p>
<p>WWR fixed that particular hack, they disallowed GET requests to the create action, only allowing POST ones.</p>
<p>However, <strong>they certainly haven&#8217;t solved the problem</strong>. It&#8217;s possible to make cross site POST requests without the user actively submitting a form. <a href="http://pastie.org/213772">This script</a> I made creates an iframe with a form inside, and submits the form. So, without a user realizing it, they&#8217;ve recommended me on WWR (I haven&#8217;t used it in this site btw).</p>
<p>It just shows that it&#8217;s fundamentally important to use a form authentication token (which Rails 2 now does by default) to prevent CSRF.</p>
<p>And, it&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that an open <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2008/05/crossdomainxml-invites-cross-site.html">crossdomain.xml file </a> would make any CSRF protections absolutely worthless, since you could go and grab that form authentication token with Flash.</p>

<p>The other day someone sent me a Powerpoint file containing some screenshots, wrong on so many levels, but perhaps some good will come out of it since it motivated  me to write this simple Air app.</p>
<p>Airdoc is a very simple Air application that registers itself to open those Office documents. It&#8217;ll then proceed to upload them to Google Docs - and open them right in your browser.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to install <a href="http://get.adobe.com/air/">Adobe Air</a> first.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.modrails.com">Mod rails</a> is certainly a step in the right direction - but I think a much better idea would be to implement support for <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org">Rack</a>. </p>
<p>Rack is an abstraction between Webservers and Ruby web frameworks. <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a>, for example, uses this to great effect - by using Rack, Thin automatically supports tons of Ruby web frameworks out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camping</li>
<li>Coset</li>
<li>Halcyon</li>
<li>Maveric</li>
<li>Merb</li>
<li>Ramaze</li>
<li>Sinatra</li>
<li>Vintage</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a Rails adapter to Rack (in the Thin repo)</p>
<p>So, wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense for the mod_rails team to work on mod_rack? Then you could upload a simple Ruby script like this to your webserver, and it would just work:</p>
<p>rack_app = Proc.new do |env|<br />
  [200, {&#8221;Content-Type&#8221;=>&#8221;text/html&#8221;}, &#8220;hello world!&#8221;]<br />
end<br />
run rack_app</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> download has been cracked <a href="http://po-ru.com/diary/bbc-iplayer-fix-hacked-again/">again</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://po-ru.com/diary/cracking-open-the-iplayer/">Paul&#8217;s neat hack</a> to allow downloading of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">IPlayer</a> programs, I thought I&#8217;d also improve the IPlayer&#8217;s pink experience by providing an RSS feed. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">Big British Castle</a>, in their infinite wisdom, don&#8217;t provide a feed to the IPlayer, but instead email you updates - how antiquated is that!</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve made a simple script that scrapes their website (with Hpricot), and constructs a RSS feed. And I have a cron job that runs it daily.<br />
For example:<br />
./iplayer-feed /path/to/apache/public/dir/iplayer-feed.rss<br />
Or in the crontab:<br />
20 4 * * * /path/to/iplayer-feed /path/to/apache/public/dir/iplayer-feed.rss  >/dev/null</p>
<p>Originally I subscribed to the daily updates (as you can see from the code). However - I underestimated how much unwatchable content they make, so I had to cut back to a few categories. Since everyone&#8217;s taste is different, I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d post the code, rather than host the feed, so people can customise it to suit themselves. </p>
<p>So, just browse the IPlayer site, choose a few categories, and paste the urls into the code. Or, take the full plunge, and subscribe to the daily updates (don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you).</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.eribium.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/iplayer-feed">code</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was interested in the performance differences between <a class="ext-link" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/"><span class="icon">Twisted</span></a> and <a class="wiki" href="http://www.rubyeventmachine.com">EventMachine</a> for an application I&#8217;ve developing which is going to have to handle a lot of load as clients will be regularly polling it.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I&#8217;m fairly new to Python and Twisted  - so there may be a way of speeding them up which I&#8217;m not aware of - perhaps by compiling to byte code or using a stackless interpreter. </p>
<p>Rather than test performance at a TCP level, I thought I&#8217;d do more of a real world example - and test HTTP servers. <a class="ext-link" href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/"><span class="icon">Thin</span></a> (combined with <a class="ext-link" href="http://rack.rubyforge.org"><span class="icon">Rack</span></a>) is a HTTP layer to <a class="wiki" href="http://www.rubyeventmachine.com">EventMachine</a>. Twisted has its own HTTP parser built in. </p>
<h2>Results (recorded with ab)</h2>
<p>Concurrency: 20<br />
Requests: 2000</p>
<p><strong>EventMachine:</strong> Requests per second:    3327.79/sec (mean)<br />
<strong>Twisted:</strong>      Requests per second:    3194.76/sec (mean)</p>
<p>Concurrency: 200<br />
Requests: 20000</p>
<p><strong>EventMachine:</strong> Requests per second:    4401.80/sec (mean)<br />
<strong>Twisted:</strong>      Requests per second:    4761.90/sec (mean)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Take these tests with a pinch of salt, as the old saying goes something along the lines of &#8216;There are lies, damned lies, and then there are statistics&#8217;.</p>
<p>The results are remarkably similar - with EM beating Twisted at some concurrency levels, and vica versa. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be an obvious difference in requests per second - even with an extremely large volume of requests.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m a bit surprised. Ruby isn&#8217;t know for it&#8217;s speed, and we&#8217;re already using 2 more gems, Thin and Rack which, although they are as light as possible, still add overhead.</p>
<p>When it comes down to virtual memory Ruby uses a hefty 47 mb, but Python isn&#8217;t much better at 39 mb. I don&#8217;t suppose that would be a deal breaker for most people though.</p>
<p>I call it a draw ;)</p>
<p>You can see the code I used <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/wiki/EMvsTwisted">here</a>.</p>
