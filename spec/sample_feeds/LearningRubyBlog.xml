<h3>A weekly series from the Ruby Masters</h3>
<p class="update">Welcome to the <b>last</b> installment of the weekly interview series on the <abbr title="RubyLearning">RL</abbr> blog - &#8220;<strong>Path to Ruby Mastery</strong>&#8221; - by top trainers and developers in the <strong>Ruby community</strong>, from across the globe. The interview series will provide insight and commentary from these notable Ruby trainers and developers, with the goal of facilitating and providing answers to the questions <strong>Ruby beginners</strong> face.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/ryan_bates.jpg" alt="Ryan Bates, USA" title="Ryan Bates, USA" width="125" height="142" /></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>his week, we&#8217;re happy to have <strong>Ryan Bates</strong> from USA.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Welcome, Ryan and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> I started toying around with static HTML around 1996. A few years later I created a website for my father&#8217;s company using this little-known scripting language called WebDNA. As the site grew, I ported it over to PHP, and then later to Rails. Needless to say, Rails has been by far the most pleasant to work with.</p>
<p>I enjoy teaching, partly because I get to learn along with whoever I&#8217;m helping by researching topics I might not have otherwise. While beginning with Rails, I started answering questions on <a href="http://railsforum.com/">railsforum.com</a>. Later I started <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a>, the free Ruby on Rails screencast series. I&#8217;m also working with the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> on a couple screencast series: <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-rbar/everyday-active-record">Everyday Active Record</a> and <a href="">Mastering Rails Forms</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Willian Molinari, Brazil>></strong> How should one go about learning the Ruby language? What material (books, eBooks, online tutorials etc.) would you recommend?</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> It depends on what your past experience is. If you are very new to programming, I recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Pragmatic-Programmers-Chris/dp/0976694042/">Learn to Program</a>. Next up the tier is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-Novice-Professional/dp/1590597664/">Beginning Ruby: From Novice to Professional</a>. And then there&#8217;s the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-Pragmatic-Programmers-Second/dp/0974514055/">Programming Ruby<a/> (also known as the Pickaxe book).</p>
<p>You may also want to <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">Try Ruby!</a>, where you can run Ruby commands interactively in your browser. If you enjoy problem solving, check out <a href="http://rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a> and a recent project of mine called <a href="http://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior/tree/master">Ruby Warrior</a> (still in early development).</p>
<p>Finally, don&#8217;t only read books and work through examples. Find a real world problem, and use Ruby to solve it. Ask questions to the community if you can&#8217;t find the solution on your own.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Dennis Theisen, Germany>></strong> Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the most, as compared to other languages? Why?</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> Ruby has spoiled me. Since learning it, I&#8217;ve found it much harder to work in other languages. These are the primary culprits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocks. They make iterations a breeze and so much more!</li>
<li>Everything&#8217;s an object. Being able to call methods directly on integers, strings, arrays, etc. greatly simplifies the method interfaces.</li>
<li>Metaprogramming. Injecting behavior at runtime opens up so many possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Jerry Anning, USA>></strong> Can you recommend things to study after learning Core Ruby, including different frameworks, gems and external libraries?</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> There&#8217;s obviously Rails which I recommend every Ruby programmer try, even if you aren&#8217;t into web development. It handles Ruby in a different way (both good and bad) than what you see in many other projects. Also, go through the various methods in Active Support and <a href="http://github.com/sam/extlib/tree/master">extlib</a>. Doing so will make reading other projects that use these easier, and may improve the code you write.</p>
<p>Also, if you haven&#8217;t already, I highly recommend signing up to <a href=http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. It has made a huge impact on improving myself as a programmer. Get inolved with other programmers, read their code, and share your own code.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Jerry Anning, USA>></strong> What best practices are most important for a new Ruby programmer to learn and understand?</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> There are three best practices which have made a world of difference for me: testing, refactoring, and naming.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to grasp automated testing. The best advice I can give is: don&#8217;t give up on it too soon. Start with a project that is easy to test (maybe the models in a simple Rails app). Once you establish a testing rhythm it gets easier, and the payoff is well worth it.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about Ruby is how natural it feels to refactor. If you don&#8217;t know what refactoring is, I recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/0201485672/">Martin Fowler&#8217;s book</a> on the subject. It&#8217;s not in Ruby, but the concepts he teaches still apply. Also keep an eye out for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321603508/">Ruby edition</a> of this book.</p>
<p>Finally, learning how to give proper names to variables, methods, and classes will help make your code much more readable. Find concise yet descriptive names and stay consistent with them across your application. This does wonders towards improving the readability of the code.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Victor Goff, USA>></strong> How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? What&#8217;s the future for Ruby? </span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> I think web applications play a very significant role in the future, not only in Ruby, but also in our society. Every day it seems we are moving away from the desktop and more into the cloud. But the buck doesn&#8217;t stop at Rails. I suspect Ruby will far outlive Rails in the web development world as we see other innovative Ruby frameworks come into play. Overall, I think Ruby has a very bright future in the work place.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Michael Uplawski, Germany>></strong> According to you, what is a comfortable size of a Ruby/Rails-project? Why?</span></p>
<p><strong>Ryan>></strong> I find Rails scales very well for a wide range of project sizes. I&#8217;ve worked with apps ranging from 3 models to 100 models and it has handled both great. The most comfortable size is probably somewhere around 10-40 models.</p>
<p>Where Rails is not as applicable are the two extremes. If you&#8217;re app is very small (only a few pages, or mostly static content), there are other languages and frameworks which are lighter weight and easier to deploy. I don&#8217;t have much experience with gigantic enterprise apps, but I imagine there&#8217;s a limit you could reach where Rails isn&#8217;t as practical in how it organizes things. As Rails improves (especially with Rails 3), it will become more and more applicable to these other types of projects.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Thanks Ryan for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants.</span></p>

<p><strong>Kurt Shuster</strong> is the CEO and Co-Founder of <strong>Noomii.com</strong>. <em>In this interview Satish Talim of RubyLearning, talks to Kurt about Noomii.com</em>.
</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Could you tell us something about <a href="http://noomii.com/">Noomii.com</a>?</span></p>
<p><strong>Kurt>></strong> Noomii.com is a website that helps any two people achieve their life goals using a process called <strong>pair coaching</strong>. Pair coaching is a type of life coaching, which normally involves paying a professional mentor to help with life goals, achievement, etc. This is a new &#8220;trend&#8221; that is starting to become popular, particularly in America. The main drawback with life coaches is that they&#8217;re expensive. The average life coach charges about USD$100 per week for a one-hour session. This is more than most people can afford. What noomii.com has done is created a system that lets any two people coach each other, for free, without any prior coaching experience or training. Instead of paying each other, they provide only their time and energy.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Kurt, why did you choose Ruby on Rails (RoR) for your product?</span></p>
<p><strong>Kurt&gt;&gt;</strong> We chose <strong>Rails</strong> for a number of reasons. First of all, we are strong believers in open source software, and made a decision early on to support open source tools, OSs, databases, etc. So we are using Linux, MySQL, etc. Rails fits naturally with this development philosophy. Also, Rails is designed to facilitate rapid development of rich web-based applications. Our particular product is pretty novel and innovative, so it naturally required a lot of iterative testing and refinement, which Rails is good at. Finally, we recognized from the beginning that Rails was growing quickly, and we believed that there would be a large and growing community of developers (who we could hire!) as well as a large set of related tools, components, plug-ins, etc.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Were there any surprises in working with RoR?</span></p>
<p><strong>Kurt&gt;&gt;</strong> Because it is so new, it&#8217;s hard to get good Rails developers. We knew this from the beginning, but I am still surprised at just how hard it is to find people who are good at Rails development. Even with the current economic collapse, layoffs in the tech world, etc, it&#8217;s still very hard to find good Rails developers.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> You made a trip to India last year and chose Persistent Systems Ltd., Pune as your offshore RoR development partner. Why Persistent and what was your impression about the RoR scene in India?</span></p>
<p><strong>Kurt&gt;&gt;</strong> I knew a sales rep from Persistent (Prashant Lele) from my days living in England. I had met with him about working on a previous project, and I was very impressed with his level of professionalism. He was very persuasive! As for the RoR scene in India, my impression is that, like everywhere else, it&#8217;s very new.  But it seems to be even less prominent in India than in America/Canada, probably because Indian IT companies tend to be a bit more conservative. Their clients tend to be large corporates rather than small startups like us, so naturally the IT scene in general leans towards older, more mature technologies such as MS, .Net, Java, etc.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> What advice would you give startups about platform choices?</span></p>
<p><strong>Kurt&gt;&gt;</strong> <em>Go open source</em>. There are lots of reasons for this. First of all, the smartest and most passionate developers are using open source. I have found that the people who know the most about a startup needs, mentality, etc, are the open-source advocates, while the MS crowd tends to be more corporate, and hence have less understanding of how to make a startup work. In a startup it&#8217;s vital to have good people, and those people are open-source people. There are other reasons, such as cost, as well as the fact that there are just so many free components, plug-ins, etc. A startup by definition has very little cash, and should be careful about spending money on anything when there&#8217;s a free alternative that&#8217;s just as good.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Getting back to Noomii, what are your future plans?</span></p>
<p><strong>Kurt&gt;&gt;</strong> We launched our beta site in October 2008, which is free to use. Of course, we have MANY changes and improvements to make to the basic system, but right now we&#8217;re focusing on building out our first &#8220;paid&#8221; system, which will be a premium subscription service for professional coaches. We also want to write a book, which will be the &#8220;content&#8221; to match the technology of the site, if that makes sense! Really, we have so many plans it makes my head spin. We just have to focus, prioritize, and start generating revenue so that we can build them. I&#8217;m really excited about what we&#8217;ll be doing in the future - we really do feel that we&#8217;re going to greatly improve the lives of many, many people.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><em>Thank you Kurt. In case you have any queries and/or questions, kindly post your questions here and Kurt would be glad to answer.</em></span></p>

<h3>A weekly series from the Ruby Masters</h3>
<p class="update">Welcome to the next installment of the weekly interview series on the <abbr title="RubyLearning">RL</abbr> blog - &#8220;<strong>Path to Ruby Mastery</strong>&#8221; - by top trainers and developers in the <strong>Ruby community</strong>, from across the globe. The interview series will provide insight and commentary from these notable Ruby trainers and developers, with the goal of facilitating and providing answers to the questions <strong>Ruby beginners</strong> face.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/thibaut.jpg" alt="Thibaut Barrere, France" title="Thibaut Barrere, France" width="116" height="132" /></p>
<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>his week, we&#8217;re happy to have <strong>Thibaut Barrere</strong> from France.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Welcome, Thibaut and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts. For the benefit of the readers, could you tell us something about your self?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> Hello! My name is Thibaut Barrere. I&#8217;m 31 years old, a husband and dad who loves to create useful things (either in Ruby or not). I became a freelancer in 2005, after working for software editors and consulting companies.</p>
<p>I do my best to share useful thoughts and tools on the <a href="http://evolvingworker.com/">Evolving Worker</a> blog. I also write <a href="http://blog.logeek.fr/2008/3/31/data-visualization-with-ruby-and-rmagick-where-are-those-bikes">Ruby tutorials on my programming blog</a>.</p>
<p>I pretty much falled in love with programming in 1984 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oric#ric-1">this was my first machine</a>). Since then I used various languages and platforms (Pascal, C++, Java, .Net&#8230;). I discovered Ruby in 2004 as I needed to parse a large amount of logs on a .Net application to understand a bug. I was amazed by how much could be achieved without knowing much of the language. Gradually I realised that Ruby and Rake were an efficient way to create easy to maintain build scripts. I got addicted to Ruby and it&#8217;s now my everyday language for most tasks.</p>
<p>I started using Rails in 2005 and it got me deeper into Ruby. Since then I&#8217;ve been using Ruby on different kinds of projects, including the <a href="http://www.villanao.co.uk/">plumbing behind a holidays rentals aggregator</a>, automation and continuous integration, logs analysis for measuring speed or business performance, CMS and blogs, <a href="http://blog.logeek.fr/2008/1/19/a-beginner-s-guide-to-datawarehouse">datawarehousing</a>, <a href="http://evolvingworker.com/2008/2/28/using-mind-mapping-data-to-drive-your-software-application">data-driven applications</a>, reporting and more regular web applications with Rails and now Merb.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Willian Molinari, Brazil>></strong> How should one go about learning the Ruby language? What material (books, eBooks, online tutorials etc.) would you recommend?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> Here are a few things that I find useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire up irb each time you wonder if Ruby does this or that - just give it a try,</li>
<li>Learn by writing your own unit-tests against the standard library - a pretty good way to understand how things work,</li>
<li>Read existing code (eg: <a href="http://github.com/aeden/activewarehouse/tree/master/">ACTIVEWAREHOUSE-ETL</a>, <a href="http://facets.rubyforge.org/">RUBY FACETS</a>, <a href="http://github.com/thoughtworks/cruisecontrol.rb/tree/master">CRUISECONTROL.RB</a>) to see how projects are structured and which idioms are used,</li>
<li>Have a look at <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PEEPCODE</a> and pick a screen-cast or a pdf randomly once in a while,</li>
<li>Finally, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177">THE RUBY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</a> by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto. It&#8217;s dense yet amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that really surprised me about Ruby is that you can use it for real without knowing much of it, since the very beginning - and learn as you go.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Keith Brady, Australia>></strong> What are the pros and cons of Ruby that are being discussed in the development community and what is your opinion on that?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> Many discussions occur around the pros and cons of X vs. Y. Part of these discussions is related to fear - will I be blamed for making the &#8220;wrong&#8221; choice ?</p>
<p>Instead of trying to compare languages or tools, I prefer to &#8220;budget&#8221; the corresponding time into trying new things out, and see what works for me or my team (eg: spend a couple of hours or one day on Silverlight, IronRuby, CouchDB, Cucumber/Webrat, Merb or Ramaze and see if it proves useful, rinse, repeat).</p>
<p>That said, the cons I often meet are:</p>
<ul>
<li>difficult to read for people coming from a static background: people used to Java, C#, C++ sometimes seem to have a hard-time starting,</li>
<li>part of the standard library has issues, like downloading files with net/http: when I was faced with these issues, I used wget/curl instead to do the job instead,</li>
<li>Ruby is slow: for what I&#8217;ve done, it has always been fast enough, or easy to scale out / refactor if needed. As well I remember C# was considered slow in 2001; I never met an issue that could not be worked out somehow, either.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pros are: </p>
<ul>
<li>pleasure: it feels good once you start using it </li>
<li>ability to innovate: quite often when having an idea, you try it out and it works </li>
<li>a lot of reusable stuff already exists so you can focus on writing new, useful code</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Dennis Theisen, Germany>></strong> Could you name three features of Ruby that you like the most, as compared to other languages? Why?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> One of the things I like most is the overall simplicity of the core classes. Most people coming from Java and C# are surprised by the fact that there is only Hash and Array (and Enumerable). As a result it&#8217;s easier for newcomers to get started.</p>
<p>Speaking of language features, I really like blocks. I believe they are the reason why we don&#8217;t have to build specialized containers that often in Ruby. I also like opened classes and duck typing, because these two features make testing and hacking around a lot easier.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of the simplicity and duck typing is that in Ruby &#8220;actual reuse&#8221; is quite common, whereas in Java and C# I mostly experienced &#8220;reusable components&#8221; that were quite difficult to reuse in reality.</p>
<p>Finally, I love the fact that Ruby code tends to be concise and that it creates a shorter path between ideas and their implementation.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Willian Molinari, Brazil>></strong> What has been your biggest challenge while working with Ruby?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> Sysadmin! I&#8217;m ok with it but it&#8217;s really Rails that got me into that. Each time I have the impression that I somehow surpassed myself, a bit like if you&#8217;re a child driving a car.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exciting more than frightening though <img src='http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Jerry Anning, USA>></strong> What best practices are most important for a new Ruby programmer to learn and understand?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> I&#8217;d focus on these ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>simplicity - ask yourself if the feature or piece of code is absolutely necessary, and write it in a way a beginner could understand. Remember that no code is faster and easier to maintain than any code,</li>
<li>source control - even if you work alone, even for a small &#8220;labs&#8221; type of applications, use SVN, Git or whatever you feel comfortable with,</li>
<li>unit-testing - learn to use Test::Unit, RSpec, mocks - the most horrible bugs I&#8217;ve tracked down could have all been avoided with a one-line unit-test,</li>
<li>continuous integration - because it&#8217;s like having an tireless assistant that can do a lot of repetitive stuff for you!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Victor Goff, USA>></strong> How do you see the market for Ruby Programmers in the work place, and do you see it as primarily tied to Rails and Web related work? Do you see trends in administration or other work? What’s the future for Ruby?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> From where I stand (I&#8217;m in France) and from what I&#8217;m doing now, the Ruby market doesn&#8217;t seem to be only tied to Rails and Web related work.</p>
<p>Ruby can be used in many fashions outside the web. For instance, a lot of companies have a need to analyze and understand their data: I&#8217;m using Ruby for a lot of different things there (statistics, reporting, data exchange, ETL&#8230;). The more we go, the more websites become front-ends on top of something that is more complicated. Some of my customers said they had no issue finding purely web Rails programmers, but that it was difficult to find people who have a good understanding of data processing, back-end etc.</p>
<p>On the future of Ruby: it&#8217;s very interesting to see more platforms adopting Ruby (I&#8217;m thinking about .Net and Java for instance). I really believe there is an opportunity for Rubyists here.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Dennis Theisen, Germany>></strong> Do you think Ruby is ready to be used in &#8220;Enterprise applications&#8221;? Kindly justify your answer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> There is as many definition of &#8220;enterprise applications&#8221; as there are companies, unfortunately. In some companies I work for, Ruby is pretty good at gluing things together, grabbing out a CSV from there, cleaning-it up, pushing it to another application (<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_eir/enterprise-integration-with-ruby">ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION WITH RUBY</a> is an interesting read on that topic). In others, Ruby is pretty good at creating large and reliable systems, iteratively. In a world-wide situation where we need to create more with less, I believe Ruby has a lot of value for Enterprise applications, in a pragmatic way.</p>
<p>So yes, Ruby is ready to create useful things for the enterprise (and has already been for a long time).</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> What can / should job candidates (for Ruby) do to distinguish themselves from their competition?<br /><strong>Note</strong>: The candidate has done his/her homework on the company that they are interviewing with. The candidate understands what they&#8217;re looking for, and the candidate is prepared to show them that he/she fits the bill, based on the candidate&#8217;s skills and experience. What else can the candidate do, to set themselves apart from other equally well-qualified and well-prepared candidates?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> Many coders are eager to propose solutions as soon as they&#8217;ve heard of a topic. A skill that is often missing (and I blame myself too sometimes) is listening! An efficient way to understand the user needs and a rare quality.</p>
<p>I also care about finding people who are willing to reuse existing stuff instead of rolling their own, whenever possible.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and people who have respect for their team-mates, too.</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Do you have any other suggestions for these participants (would-be Ruby developers)?</span></p>
<p><strong>Thibaut>></strong> My first suggestion would be to focus your energy on creating useful code and building things instead of arguing with others whether Ruby is a good choice or not.</p>
<p>My second suggestion would be to pick up a simple idea you have, something that would be useful to you first and to implement it. Real artists ship!</p>
<p><span style="color:#CC3333;"><strong>Satish Talim>></strong> Thanks Thibaut for sharing your views with the RubyLearning participants.</span></p>
<p class="note">On 20th Jan. we talk to <strong>Ryan Bates</strong> from USA.</p>
