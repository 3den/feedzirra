			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a little late in mentioning this, but I recently spoke at <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsconfEurope</a> about <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com/cs/railseurope2007/view/e_sess/14232">Rails Refactoring</a>. It was a tutorial talk, and I thought that it went very well. I think the presentation is up on O&#8217;Reilly somewhere; I&#8217;ll link if I can find it.</p>
<p>Overall, the conference was really good. Berlin is an amazing city and the majority of the talks were really good. Of special note were the ones by <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/">Dr. Nic</a>, <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Topfunky</a>, and <a href=http://blog.fallingsnow.net/">Evan Phoenix</a>. Their talks about ruby magic, css generation, and rubinius were really well done.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, last Tuesday nyc.rb turned three years old. Of course, we were not content with just turning three, so we decided to start taping our presentations also (By we, I mean me, because I have a video camera and turned it on). Francis gave a testing clinic, while yours truly gave a talk on refactoring. Both talks are available on Motionbox (the Rails video site at which I work) at <a href="http://www.motionbox.com/playlist/show/4a9fddb51f1cc4">this playlist</a>.</p>
<p>To make things easier for you, I&#8217;ve also embeded the videos after the jump. Francis&#8217;s video is first with mine second. Sorry for the occasional fuzzy video quality, I&#8217;m still not good at filming presentations.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another software problem. This time, I&#8217;m taking the advice of <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com">Zed Shaw</a> and attempting to use <a href="http://macvim.org">gvim</a> for my text editing.  I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a>, but I change my editor about as often as I workout (aka every two months). Enough rambling, gvim has support for this cool thing called ctags. I haven&#8217;t investigated it enough yet, but it&#8217;s apparently used to allow you to jump to the definition of a function, class, or what-have-you very easliy. Sounds cool right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the version of ctags that ships with Mac OS X is a piece of crap. Looking at the man page it&#8217;s only version 3.0 from 1993. That&#8217;s 13 years ago for those of you not into math. Anyway, <b>the fix</b> is simple (that&#8217;s in bold for those of you from google). Just install <a href="http://www.darwinports.org">Darwin Port</a> and then enter </p>
<pre>sudo port install ctags</pre>
<p>That&#8217;ll get you up and good with a modern version.</p>
<p>P.S. - If you really want to install this by source and do not know how, let me know. I can easily do another write up on how that&#8217;s done.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though building sites with ssl is cool and gives your users a sense of security, configuring a webserver with ssl can be a royal pain. Thankfully, there&#8217;s pound.  <a href="">Pound</a> is a &#8220;is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end for Web server(s).&#8221;</p>
<p>Pound is dead simple to setup and configure. Unfortunately, the darwin port for pound is old and does not work. So this guide will help you build pound on your own. Besides, everyone feels cooler after compiling that hot fire. Click on for the steps.</p>
<ol>
<a id="more-29"></a></p>
<li>Open terminal.</li>
<li>Install zlib</li>
<pre>
mkdir ~/temp
curl -O http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
tar xzvf zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.3
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --shared
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<li>Install openssl</li>
<pre>
curl -O http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8b.tar.gz
tar xzvf openssl-0.9.8b.tar.gz
cd openssl-0.9.8b
./config -L/usr/local/lib --openssldir=/usr/local/etc/openssl \
    zlib no-asm no-krb5 shared
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<li>Install Pound 2.0 or greater</li>
<pre>
curl -O http://www.apsis.ch/pound/Pound-2.0.tgz
tar xzvf Pound-2.0.tgz
cd Pound-2.0
sed "s/-o bin -g bin //g" < Makefile.in > Makefile.in.new
mv Makefile.in.new Makefile.in  # Hit y to override any restrictions
./configure &#8211;with-ssl=/usr/local/etc/openssl/ &#8211;prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<li>Generate an ssl certificate.</li>
<pre>
cd /usr/local/etc
</pre>
<p>You can put the next line in ~/.bash_profile if you want openssl available everytime you open the terminal.</p>
<pre>
export PATH="/usr/local/etc/openssl/bin:$PATH"
sudo openssl/bin/openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout our_cert.pem \
    -out our_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
</pre>
<p>Fill out the required information to generate the ssl certificate.</p>
<li>Create a pound.cfg file.</li>
<pre>
cd /usr/local/etc # You should already be here
</pre>
<p>This next piece uses a trick called a heredoc. Instead of copying and pasting the below command into terminal, you could also just copy and paste the text into pound.cfg in /usr/local/etc/pound.cfg</p>
<pre>
cat &gt; ~/tmp_file &lt;&lt;EOF
ListenHTTP
  Address 0.0.0.0
  Port    80
  Service
    BackEnd
      Address 127.0.0.1
      Port    3000
    End
  End
End

ListenHTTPS
  Address 0.0.0.0
  Port    443
  Cert    "/usr/local/etc/our_cert.pem"
  # pass along https hint
  AddHeader "X-Forwarded-Proto: https"
  HeadRemove "X-Forwarded-Proto"
  Service
    BackEnd
      Address 127.0.0.1
      Port    3000
    End
  End
End
EOF
sudo mv ~/tmp_file ./pound.cfg
</pre>
<li>Make sure that pound works.</li>
<pre>
pound -v -c
</pre>
<p>You should see Config file /usr/local/etc/pound.cfg is OK.<br />
If not, make sure that you copied your config file correctly<br />
using &#8216;cat pound.cfg&#8217; to view what is in the file.</p>
<li>Turn off apache (assuming it&#8217;s running).</li>
<pre>sudo apachectl stop</pre>
<li>Turn on pound.</li>
<pre>sudo pound -v</pre>
<li>Start mongrel/webrick/lighty.</li>
<pre>
cd ~/work/my_killer_app
mongrel_rails start # Or ruby script/server (if you're still on lighty/webrick)
</pre>
<li>Marvel at your wonderous creation by pointing your browser to http://localhost/ or https://localhost/</li>
</ol>
<p>TODO (feel free to do these and post how to do them in the comments):
<ul>
<li>Make pound start when the computer loads.</li>
<li>Use darwin ports to install zlib and openssl, but not pound.</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, this is basic css, but I&#8217;ll throw it up here for those of you that don&#8217;t know or have forgotten (I managed to forget the other day). If you have an element with &#8216;float: left&#8217; or &#8216;float: right&#8217; inside a div, the div will not be tall enough to hold the floated element. Look:</p>
<div>
<p style="float:left;width: 150px;">I am crazy floating text.  Watch out for me because I am so crazy.  I will kill any and all layouts near me.  Hear me roar!</p>
<p>I am the cool words to the right.</p>
</div>
<p>I am broken! I should be below the text that is to my left.</p>
<p><br style="clear:both" /><br />
As you can see, the code above is definitely broken. To fix this problem, we need only insert a &#60;br style=&#34;clear:both;&#34; /&#62 at the bottom of the div.  Look now:</p>
<div>
<p style="float:left;width: 150px;">I am crazy floating text.  Watch out for me because I am so crazy.  I will kill any and all layouts near me.  Hear me roar!</p>
<p>I am the cool words to the right.</p>
<p>  <br style="clear:both;" />
</div>
<p>I am fixed! The crazy floating text plagues me no more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As tempting as it is to use it for everything, the rails session should be used sparingly.  In reading through the code for my current project, I noticed that we are using the session for storing return urls and query strings when doing login redirects.  This is <strong>bad</strong>.</p>
<p><a id="more-26"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example of user behavior to see why:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user types http://superapp.com/account/logged_in into their browser.</li>
<li>This url is protected to the user is redirected to http://superapp.com/account/login and /account/logged_in is stored in session[:jump_to].</li>
<li>The user gets confused, lost, or just behaves like a typical user and navigates somewhere else.</li>
<li>Sometime later, the user goes to http://superapp.com/account/login and logs in.</li>
<li>The user is taken to &#8216;/account/logged_in&#8217; instead of &#8216;account/welcome&#8217;.  The user is confused.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though user confusion on its own is bad, this still may not seem like much of a problem.  So the user gets redirected to a different url than usual, how bad is that?  In the app I&#8217;m currently working on, this behavior can be very bad. Depending on how the user is coming to the site and logging in, a bad return url can cause significant confusion to the user.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, the flash should be used instead of the session.  Though the flash technically is the session, it is automatically cleared after each request.  This prevents time sensitive data such as redirection urls from being stored longer than necessary and guarantees that you do not confuse your user with seemingly different points of entry on login.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a reminder when working with arrays of objects generated with Active Record.</p>
<pre>
[Model.find(1), Model.find(2), Model.find(3)] -

</pre>
<p>This does not behave as you would expect, because array subtraction compares elements on their object ids. Each find generates a new object, with a new id, so subtraction does not work. To get the behavior desired, do this instead:</p>
<pre>
to_be_removed = [Model.find(1)].map{|m| m.id}
[Model.find(1), Model.find(2), Model.find(3)].
  delete_if{|m| to_be_removed.include?(m.id)}
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s not as beautiful, but it gets the job done.</p>
