Over on the Business of Software group, we’re <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.724788.12">discussing</a> those big bureaucratic companies who want a custom legal agreement to buy $79 worth of software. “Lawyer-infested companies that are obsessive-compulsive about contracts do not pirate software and they CERTAINLY don’t try to trick you into signing a contract ‘allowing’ them to pirate your software. This theory is laughable.”

<p>Just because there’s room on the dialog box, doesn’t mean you have to put something there. The Java installer starts off with a dialog box that manages to repeat the word Java six times without really telling you what it is, just that it’s “everywhere.”</p>

<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/01/the-thing-about.html">Seth Godin reminded me about having goals</a>. “Having goals is a pain in the neck,” he says, but “the people who get things done, who lead, who grow and who make an impact... those people have goals.”</p>
<p>OK, good point. Here are Fog Creek Software’s goals for 2009, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ship FogBugz 7.0 for all platforms</li>
<li>Ship Copilot Desktop for all platforms</li>
<li>Release the next documentary about software development</li>
<li>Build a kick-ass new product from the ground up with the summer interns, and get the first dollar of customer revenue before they go back to school</li>
<li>Put on a fantastic <a href="http://www.businessofsoftware.org/">Business of Software conference</a></li>
<li>Relive <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/08/16.html">the glory days</a> with another FogBugz World Tour</li></ul>
<p>I like what Seth said about how “if you don't have a goal, you never have to worry about missing it.”</p>

	<title>Copilot OneClick for Macintosh</title>

<p>Fog Creek Copilot is an inexpensive, and very easy to use, remote tech support system that allows you to remote-control someone else’s computer over the Internet without installing anything special. It’s perfect for ad-hoc tech support, and used extensively by helpdesks, software companies providing telephone support, and people helping their friends and families with computer problems. At Fog Creek, we even use it to conduct coding interviews for programmers.</p>
<p>The new Copilot OneClick feature lets you preinstall the software on all the computers you connect to frequently, so every time your dad calls up needing help with the accounting software running his Ponzi scheme, you just click one link and you’re logged onto his computer.</p>
<p>As usual, it works through all kinds of firewalls, proxies, and NATs without any configuration, it’s protected by 128-bit SSL, and there’s never anything to configure.</p>
<p>Today, the Copilot team released the Macintosh version of the OneClick feature, so all the Copilot goodness is available on Windows or Mac, or both (you can control Windows computers from Macs and vice versa). And it’s <a href="https://www.copilot.com/SignUp/">cheap</a>, by which I mean, inexpensive—I don’t mean that you can just buy it two drinks and take it back to your apartment and expect to be taking a bubble bath with it—most people get the $19.95 unlimited plan; it’s even free on weekends when we have lots of unused bandwidth.</p>
<p>Read about the team’s <a href="http://blog.copilot.com/2009/01/available-immediately-copilot-oneclick-for-mac-.html">experience developing a Mac-based installer</a>, then try the <a href="https://www.copilot.com/FreeTrial/">free trial</a>! Bubble bath not included!</p>
