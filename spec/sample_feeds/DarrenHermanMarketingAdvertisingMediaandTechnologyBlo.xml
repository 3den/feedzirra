			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="For Sale" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1172/1111941469_afc92b177c_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /><span class="drop"><span class="drop">I</span></span>’ve always talked about creating a <a title="Swimming in the deadpool" href="../2008/01/25/swimming-in-the-deadpool/">vulture fund</a>, but haven’t executed on it for one reason or another.</p>
<div>Something that I can execute however is an email list that would update you on interesting companies/technologies/assets for sale that could benefit your digital media organization.  Whether you’re in the M&amp;A department of IAC or Google, a private equity fund, or a business owner/entrepreneur who wants to branch into new areas, this email list is for you.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The inspiration for this list comes from two recent emails I received from friends showcasing some interesting acquisition opportunities.  Additionally, I’ve been speaking to some entrepreneurial friends who want to sell their companies and/or projects and don’t have a simple method for doing so.</div>
<div>Very brief opportunities (email to be much more in-depth):</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><a title="Marketplace Sitepoint" href="http://marketplace.sitepoint.com/auctions/55641">StreetRead</a>:  Financial News App that appeared on Webware, Lifehacker, Wall Street &amp; Tech, etc.</li>
<li><a title="heyamigo" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=170294189016">HeyAmigo</a>:  PPC Newsletter advertising</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>Both opportunities above have significant market opportunity if they fall into the right hands.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The email list will be either every two weeks or monthly, so don’t expect a significant volume of emails.</div>
<p></p>
<div>They will be coming from my <a title="Hermanblackbook" href="http://www.hermanblackbook.com/">Herman blackbook</a> email account.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Please sign up for the <a title="Email List" href="http://hermanblackbook.wufoo.com/forms/hb-60seconds-of-ma/">list here</a>.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Crunchies" src="http://www.centernetworks.com/images/sites/crunchiesleft1.png" alt="" width="175" height="47" /><span class="drop">I</span>&#8217;m a huge fan of celebrating superior products, services, and people.  Last night was the <a title="Crunchies" href="http://crunchies2008.techcrunch.com/">Crunchies</a> - an award ceremony for industry achievement within digital media.  Cnet has a <a title="Cnet - Crunchies" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10139654-2.html">very nice writeup</a>.  I wasn&#8217;t able to attend due to some client meetings that I had to be in New York for, but was able to participate both through voting prior and caught the Ustream feed during.  Overall, I was impressed with the event itself and how all the partners came together and made it happen.  I could nitpick but I&#8217;ll leave that up to the other bloggers <a title="Crunchies - Bloggers" href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2009/01/what-is-international-my-crunchies-video-mashup.html">around</a> the world.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t like about award shows inclusive of The Crunchies and any other show (e.g. the <a title="Mixx Awards" href="http://www.mixx-expo.com/2.8/default_awards.aspx">MIXX Awards</a>) is that they typically neglect to account for the real business behind the product, service, company, or campaign.  We celebrate some big or creative ideas but in many cases, it doesn&#8217;t translate into business sense.</p>
<p>An example of what I&#8217;m trying to say is celebrating a social media campaign for say a brand.  While the campaign may have achieve buzz or made the front page of Digg/NY Times, did it actually produce sales for the client or shift positive perception of the brand?    More often than not, voting is tied to buzz surrounding a particular company.  Just think of the movie industry, the movies that the studios select as their best always come out around the time for nominations of the Oscars, as they want the population to vote for them.</p>
<p>Gaming awards shows?</p>
<p>In the digital media space, there were many companies at the Crunchies who have a lot of buzz surrounding them but when you meet with them and get under the hood for business purposes, they are fairly empty.  We&#8217;re celebrating their slick interface or the parties they throw in the valley, but other than that, what else do they provide us?   There are many companies in digital media across the world who may not be sexy, but may have a much stronger balance sheet.</p>
<p>I may be going off on a rant, but I hope that what I&#8217;m trying to say comes trough.  I don&#8217;t have a solution for change but know that we should be celebrating real businesses, not smoke &amp; mirrors.  CenterNetworks Allen Stern was an <a title="Inspiration - Allen Stern" href="http://www.centernetworks.com/crunchies-2008-learnings#comment-104153">inspiration for this post</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.darrenherman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/hermanblackbookemailheader.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-886 alignleft" title="Herman blackbook header" src="http://www.darrenherman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/hermanblackbookemailheader-300x50.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="50" /></a></p>
<p><span class="drop">I</span> thought I&#8217;d write this post to recap the first 72 hours of <a title="Launch NPF" href="http://hermanblackbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=60">launching</a> the <a title="Official Page" href="http://hermanblackbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=57">New Platforms Fund</a> thru <a title="Hb" href="http://www.hermanblackbook.com">Herman blackbook</a>.  Upon waking up this past Friday morning, we received front page coverage on <a title="TechCrunch" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/02/if-you-are-really-really-desperate-for-cash-these-guys-will-give-you-3k/">TechCrunch</a> with a less than stellar headline and then became top billing on <a title="Mashable" href="mashable.com/2009/01/02/new-platforms-fund/">Mashable</a>.  Upon logging onto Twitter, started receiving DM&#8217;s from friends and folks I&#8217;ve never met with strong support for both the New Platforms Fund and Herman blackbook.</p>
<p>The initial gut reaction that most people had to the fund, as illustrated on TechCrunch, was in some cases negative, as $1-3k investments are in themselves, small.  Yes, that amount of money is extremely small, but what we&#8217;re trying to fund are simple applications of technologies off of innovative platforms from the napkin or alpha stage.  Beyond the dollar, we&#8217;re offering our network of Herman blackbook, which has been billed behind closed doors as the next generation of <a title="Allen &amp; Co." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_&amp;_Company">Allen &amp; Co</a>.</p>
<p>The response has been tremendous.  Within 12 hours, we had over 40 serious submissions ranging from from applications on Twitter, the iPhone, Android, and the Google API.  There were some miscellaneous submissions but we discarded them as they didn&#8217;t reside on a platform.  As of writing this on 6pm on Sunday afternoon, we have doubled our submissions and are combing through each one in-depth.</p>
<p>I also had several members of the press reach out to me and spoke to them about the vision of what Hb and the New Platforms Fund has.  The press, most notably some of the top financial periodicals and tech reporters of industry mags were asking me about why we chose to fund companies that <strong>do not own the platform</strong> in which they are building upon.  Very valid question and I used to wrestle with this as well.  My standpoint is that a rising tide raises all ships - meaning, we can make a platform more valuable by building on top of it.  No one ever said that innovation comes without risks.</p>
<p>We finished going through the first 50 ideas submitted and have written down why we aren&#8217;t going to be moving forward with many of them.  <strong>I thought it would be beneficial to all entrepreneurs out there to see why ideas may be rejected as this is a great learning experience</strong>.  These are <a title="Hb New Platforms Fund Page" href="http://hermanblackbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=57">posted on Hb</a>, but I&#8217;ve also pasted here:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not have any existing domain knowledge in the particular market of which these ideas/concepts were submitted.  The power of Hb is more than just money; it&#8217;s our network and experience.  If we fund certain ideas, we want to ensure that they have the best opportunity to succeed.</li>
<li>Not a big idea.  Some of the ideas we&#8217;ve seen are just not big enough in terms of opportunity.</li>
<li>Competitive environment.  The market which the ideas/concept fall into are crowded and we&#8217;d rather place our bets in a less crowded space.</li>
<li>Market opportunity is limited.  If we need to approach the market with only a 3 month window to generate revenue, we are most likely to pass.</li>
<li>Idea doesn&#8217;t sit ontop of a platform.  Our fund is all about being part of an ecosystem and platforms such as Boxee, Appnexus, Twitter, etc.  Your idea should sit on top of a platform.</li>
<li>Explanation of idea was not clear from the description.</li>
<li>While we are investing in ideas and concepts, we couldn&#8217;t figure out the business application for it.</li>
<li>As much as we love video games, film, and music, we don&#8217;t invest in specific projects such as a new game, movie, or band.  We will however invest in services around an industry.  We try to stay away from very hit driven businesses.</li>
<li>No barriers to entry into the market.</li>
<li>Who is the team leader?  Should have experience relevant to the idea.</li>
<li>Lastly, not within the funds scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each bullet point above is at least a blog post in itself.  Feel free to comment and I&#8217;ll respond in-depth if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>Looking forward to <a title="New Platforms Fund" href="http://hermanblackbook.wufoo.com/forms/new-platforms-fund/">more submissions</a> and making the Hb process a learning experience for everyone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop">H</span>appy New Year to everyone!  I want to start 2009 strong by announcing the <a title="New Platforms Fund" href="http://hermanblackbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=60"><strong>New Platforms Fund</strong></a> to empower developers of applications on top of platforms such as Twitter, <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a>, <a href="http://www.appnexus.com">AppNexus</a>, Trulia, iPhone, and more.  The goal of the fund is to seed up to 10 cutting edge ideas with both money and human capital to bring them from concept to alpha stage.  New Platforms Fund investments will range from $1-3,000 each.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning to having the news be on the <a title="TechCrunch" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/02/if-you-are-really-really-desperate-for-cash-these-guys-will-give-you-3k/">front page of TechCrunch</a>.  While not the ideal headline, it&#8217;s still up on TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/02/if-you-are-really-really-desperate-for-cash-these-guys-will-give-you-3k/"><img class="alignnone" title="TechCrunch IMage" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/3159794486_df1f27e61b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>As many of you know, I LOVE new technologies and rolling up my sleeves to help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to reality.  We&#8217;ve seen some amazing platforms built in 2007/08 such as the aforementioned and now, we&#8217;ve got quite a few applications and layers being built on top of them.  I&#8217;m interested in getting my hands dirty here and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve launched this fund.</p>
<p>If you click the link over to the site, you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s under <a title="Herman blackbook" href="http://www.hermanblackbook.com">Herman blackbook</a>, which is my new personal consulting/advising/investing vehicle.  While it&#8217;s being formerly (and legally) created, I&#8217;ve run the idea past some amazing and proven entrepreneurs and they loved it.  One of them termed it, &#8220;<strong>Allen &amp; Co. of tomorrow</strong>&#8221; - YES.  The network that we&#8217;ve assembled for Hb is tremendous and could really help any company in the sweet spot of technology, digital media, marketing, and entertainment.  Don&#8217;t be a stranger - <a href="http://www.hermanblackbook.com">check out the site</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway - if you or someone you know is thinking of building something ontop of one of the platforms, we&#8217;d love to hear from them.  You can <a href="http://hermanblackbook.wufoo.com/forms/new-platforms-fund/">submit your ideas/concepts here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to take a minute and thank my wife, <a href="http://www.hermanweb.us">Sherri</a>, and my 8 week old son, David, for putting up with me over the past few days as I&#8217;ve worked on getting this up and running.  They have been absolutely incredible and my wife has been extremely supportive&#8230; she now really knows what marrying an entrepreneur is all about.  (note, she&#8217;s also an investor in <a title="Path101" href="http://www.path101.com">Path101</a>)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop">I</span> generally hate buzzwords.  I can stand them for a short period of time, but when they become mainstream they turn into my pet peeve.  Social Media has been a word that we started hearing about a few years ago and now everyone and their mother have turned into social media experts or have even launched social media consultancies.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many people I meet at conferences or through this blog who have newly launched social media consultancies, but when talking to them in-depth about their organization, they are nothing more than a glorified PR consultant.  There&#8217;s a newly launched group of &#8220;social media experts&#8221; who band together to provide social media bootcamps for a few grand a day which tell marketing executives to put a few tags on their blog posts, create microchunked video content, and other web marketing tactics.</p>
<p>I was joking on Twitter earlier today and asked how many social media experts were needed to screw in a light bulb and my friend <a title="Twitter Jon Bur" href="http://www.twitter.com/jonburg">@jonburg</a> answered:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="@jonburg response" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3090/3146540006_c1ccb34471_o.png" alt="" width="528" height="63" /></p>
<p>Wikipedia has a fairly comprehensive definition of social media and it compares it to industrial media.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Social media</strong> are primarily Internet- and mobile-based tools for sharing and discussing information among human beings.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The term most often refers to activities that integrate technology, telecommunications and social interaction, and the construction of words, pictures, videos and audio. This interaction, and the manner in which information is presented, depends on the varied perspectives and &#8220;building&#8221; of shared meaning among communities, as people share their stories and experiences. Businesses also refer to social media as <a title="User-generated content" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">user-generated content</a> (UGC) or <a title="Consumer generated media" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_generated_media">consumer-generated media</a> (CGM).</p></blockquote>
<p>I argue on all panels and speaking engagements I partake in is that there should be <strong>NO</strong> dividing line between social media and industrial media.  When you put a line in the middle, you fragment marketing and it does not work as exponentially positive as it can.  It&#8217;s sort of like separating out a digital agency from a traditional agency&#8230; everything should be together to create bigger integrated idea.</p>
<p>When looking deeper into the term &#8220;social media&#8221; on job trends, we see that the exact term has been used in job postings quite a bit since September &#8216;06.  <a title="Social Media job chart" href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=%22social+media%22&amp;l=">The job chart</a> below was provided by Indeed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Job Chart:  Social Media" src="http://www.indeed.com/trendgraph/jobgraph.png?q=%22social+media%22" alt="" width="540" height="300" /></p>
<p>I wanted to add &#8220;media planning&#8221;, &#8220;media strategy&#8221; and &#8220;viral&#8221; into the chart to see what job trends I could find.  What I am fascinated to see is that &#8220;social media&#8221; surpassed &#8220;viral&#8221; in job listings (and trends).  Another pet peeve is when clients as me to produce a viral video or create content that will become viral.  We (as strategists) can put all of the necessary technology in place to make media become portable and in such a fashion for people to easily consume it, but we can&#8217;t guarantee that anything will become viral as that&#8217;s what the consumer does.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Social Media Chart" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3250/3145747869_11d8753092_o.png" alt="" width="542" height="301" /></p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit is that media strategy (and planning) should contain &#8220;social media.&#8221;  Recruiters and HR folks are using the latest buzzwords of the moment in their job listings so that&#8217;s creating the increase in the chart lines, but everything here should be part of the same job description.</p>
<p>There is burgeoning industry around SMO, or <a title="Social Media Optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_optimization">social media optimization</a>.  There are currently 321,000 exact matches in Google for &#8220;Social Media Optimization&#8221; after searching for it tonight.  Essentially, SMO is similar to SEO, <em>but methods of SMO include adding <a class="mw-redirect" title="RSS feed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_feed">RSS feeds</a>, <a title="Social news" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_news">social news</a> buttons, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Blogging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogging">blogging</a>, and incorporating third-party community functionalities like <a title="Image hosting service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_hosting_service">images</a> and <a title="Video hosting service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_hosting_service">videos</a>. Social media optimization is related to <a title="Search engine marketing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_marketing">search engine marketing</a>, but differs in several ways, primarily the focus on driving traffic from sources other than search engines, though improved search ranking is also a benefit of successful SMO</em>. (<a title="Social Media Optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_optimization">wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>The point I&#8217;m trying to drive home in this blog post is to include any of this &#8220;social media&#8221; speak into traditional media strategies.  All media is social and has been social for years.  As long as people have been talking (forever), then any media showcased to them has become social.  Kill the buzzword and focus at the main challenge at hand:  create winning multidimensional media strategies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop">I</span> was speaking with a friend and co-investor (<a title="InfoArbitrage" href="http://twitter.com/infoarbitrage">@infoarbitrage</a>) last weekend and we were discussing scaling issues in this new world.  One of the comments that we both wrote down was, “<strong>anything above buying power is organizational inefficiency</strong>.”</p>
<p>Big business used to be about building an infrastructure and then leveraging it as a competitive barrier to entry.  Think of the automotive world.  Think of the advertising world.  Think of the airline industry.  Think of pharma.  Are these businesses where you want to be today?  In a broad sense, probably not.</p>
<p>It used to be, “the larger you become, the more you can make a market.”  How many of us in the digital media world do not envy Yahoo!?  Yahoo is still a $17 billion company but full of inefficiencies.   What about MSFT?  IBM?</p>
<p>In the advertising world, how many holding companies and agencies do you know that have multiple companies, which in turn, duplicate organizational structure.  In a world that is shifting towards transparency and collaboration, why separate all of these companies out?  The knowledge and personnel that exists within each of those four walls is invaluable to the future of any one of the clients.</p>
<p>The future structure of organizations may be leaner and more nimble, and the discount of infrastructure may play out more than we may think.  Think about Toll Brothers (real estate) right now…</p>

<p>I have a specific vision that I&#8217;m going to illustrate in a general white paper in the coming weeks, and would love to begin the conversation here.</p>
<p>If you are involved in advertising, marketing, technology, infrastructure, or anything else tangentially related to the industry, I hope you comment.  I know a large readership of this blog is part of this, so I&#8217;m hoping many comments will follow.</p>
<p>I will kick start the comments section&#8230;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop">I</span>&#8217;ve spent the past year (and change) at a <a title="MediaKitchen" href="http://www.mediakitchen.tv">top media agency</a> here in New York and constantly attend plenty of technology conferences (like Web2.0, DPAC, etc) and listen to entrepreneurs on stage bashing ad agencies because they don&#8217;t understand technology business [insert publisher here].</p>
<p>Put yourself in ad agency shoes:  think of how many startups are emerging (according to <a title="Crunchbase" href="http://www.crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>:  12,334) and imagine how many 1/2 hour meetings it would take to listen to every single pitch and then make rationale decisions re: where to invest media dollars with promising startups.  That would be 257 days straight of meetings, with no new startups launching past 12,334.  Impossible.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not a cry for help, but rather an informative post about how to get and STAY on an agencies radar.  Here are some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by an extremely personable email or call.  If you are worth your ad-sales compensation, you will find out how to get in contact with us as it&#8217;s fairly simple.  No template emails please; they don&#8217;t even pass my spam filter.</li>
<li>Educate us.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many people call me and tell me they are cheaper than alternatives right off the bat.  Why?  Educate us so you can show us your value proposition.  Tell us about your industry, don&#8217;t assume we know it.  You&#8217;re in it every single day, we are not.</li>
<li>Be responsive.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many times we bypass vendors/partners because they were not responsive on the previous campaign we did with them.  Ad sales does not stop once the Insertion Order has been signed.</li>
<li>Lunch &amp; Learns:  Offer to educate the entire agency and bring the appropriate people (senior folks with good presentation skills).  Coming prepared with a simple lunch helps; remember, the goal is to get people to attend and free lunch always helps.</li>
<li>Stay in touch but don&#8217;t pester.  Offering to take the team out for drinks always helps.</li>
<li>Understanding that even though you&#8217;ve made a media plan for a particular advertiser in the past does not mean you will make one in the future.  Every single media plan has a certain objective and strategy and overall obs/strats can change quarterly.</li>
<li>We generally don&#8217;t care that you landed $30MM in funding from Venture Fund ABC, but we do care about your latest new ad-unit or really cool metric you are monitoring (such as <a title="Lotame Time on Screen" href="http://www.lotame.com/uploaded_files/press/releases/R_297159f9cc9021bad582d697ed57967d11.11.08%20-%20Mindshare_TimeSpent.pdf">Lotame&#8217;s time on screen</a>).</li>
<li>Case studies help.  While talking about a particular ad campaign idea is interesting, showcasing it to us with all of the different components is extremely helpful.  Seeing something in action helps tremendously.</li>
<li>If the idea is totally new, creating mockups certainly helps; come prepared to meetings with them as it excites media planners and allows us to send through to the client.  See number #8 too.</li>
<li>Your excitement shines through.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve met with ad sales folks who are not excited about the product they are selling.  This shows. You should be passionate, and we can see right through any fake passion.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we can&#8217;t meet with every single startup emerging, we try to do a landscape survey of different trends (online video, social targeting, entertainment platforms, etc) and meet with a few companies from each space.  If you think we&#8217;ve missed you, please read step #1 and reach out.</p>
