h2. Benchmarks

One of the goals of Feedzirra is speed. This includes not only parsing, but fetching multiple feeds as quickly as possible. I ran a benchmark getting 20 feeds 10 times using Feedzirra, rFeedParser, and FeedNormalizer. For more details the "benchmark code can be found in the project in spec/benchmarks/feedzirra_benchmarks.rb":http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/blob/7fb5634c5c16e9c6ec971767b462c6518cd55f5d/spec/benchmarks/feedzirra_benchmarks.rb
<pre>
feedzirra          5.170000   1.290000   6.460000 ( 18.917796)
rfeedparser      104.260000  12.220000 116.480000 (244.799063)
feed-normalizer   66.250000   4.010000  70.260000 (191.589862)
</pre>
The result of that benchmark is a bit sketchy because of the network variability. Running 10 times against the same 20 feeds was meant to smooth some of that out. However, there is also a "benchmark comparing parsing speed in spec/benchmarks/parsing_benchmark.rb":http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/blob/7fb5634c5c16e9c6ec971767b462c6518cd55f5d/spec/benchmarks/parsing_benchmark.rb on an atom feed.
<pre>
feedzirra        0.500000   0.030000   0.530000 (  0.658744)
rfeedparser      8.400000   1.110000   9.510000 ( 11.839827)
